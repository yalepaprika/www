{"slug":"the-graphic-narrative","title":{"rendered":"The Graphic Narrative"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The Graphic Narrative is a momentary respite from the high stress atmosphere of final reviews. Inspired by Chris Ware’s <em>Building Stories</em> and other graphic narratives, the centerfold presents a variety of student contributions that emphasize the ability of graphic content to convey a story. The cover features Paprika, herself, presenting on the ground: a collection of recent and relevant stories from around the school. While the Issue is a chronicle of work from the School of Architecture, it also recognizes the school’s frame of mind at the time of its release. In this fold we’ve provided a collection of activities aimed at relieving the tension between reviews. We welcome all to indulge in the graphic narrative as a substitute to napping!</p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"25","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2016-05-02","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22002050/Vol-01-Issue-25_Visual-Narrative_Fernaux-Ma-Min_05-02-16.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":2025,"height":1823,"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22010224/Vol-01-Issue-25_Visual_Narrative_Fernaux-Ma-Min_05-02-16_front.jpg"}}}}}}
