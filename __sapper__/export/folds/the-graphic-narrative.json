{"slug":"the-graphic-narrative","title":{"rendered":"The Graphic Narrative"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The Graphic Narrative is a momentary respite from the high stress atmosphere of final reviews. Inspired by Chris Ware’s <em>Building Stories</em> and other graphic narratives, the centerfold presents a variety of student contributions that emphasize the ability of graphic content to convey a story. The cover features Paprika, herself, presenting on the ground: a collection of recent and relevant stories from around the school. While the Issue is a chronicle of work from the School of Architecture, it also recognizes the school’s frame of mind at the time of its release. In this fold we’ve provided a collection of activities aimed at relieving the tension between reviews. We welcome all to indulge in the graphic narrative as a substitute to napping!</p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"25","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2016-05-02","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22002050/Vol-01-Issue-25_Visual-Narrative_Fernaux-Ma-Min_05-02-16.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22010224/Vol-01-Issue-25_Visual_Narrative_Fernaux-Ma-Min_05-02-16_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Seokim Min"},"slug":"seokim-min"},{"title":{"rendered":"Anne Ma"},"slug":"anne-ma"},{"title":{"rendered":"Hugo Fenaux"},"slug":"hugo-fenaux"}],"coordinating_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Tess McNamara"},"slug":"tess-mcnamara"},{"title":{"rendered":"Maggie Tsang"},"slug":"maggie-tsang"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ana Pinto"},"slug":"ana-pinto"},{"title":{"rendered":"Asad Pervaiz"},"slug":"asad-pervaiz-2"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"The Graphic Narrative Submissions"},"slug":"the-graphic-narrative-submissions","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"#POMOPARTY"},"slug":"pomoparty","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ha Min Joo"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Crossword"},"slug":"crossword","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Final Reviews Bingo!"},"slug":"final-reviews-bingo","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Francesca Carney"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Book Review: Building Stories"},"slug":"book-review-building-stories","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Hugo Fenaux"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Congratulations to the Class of 2016!"},"slug":"congratulations-to-the-class-of-2016","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Lisa Albaugh"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"The Origins of PVA"},"slug":"the-origins-of-pva","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Health and Wellness"},"slug":"health-and-wellness-2","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Madelynn Ringo"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Ode to Second Year"},"slug":"ode-to-second-year","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Katie Stege"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"ON THE GROUND"},"slug":"on-the-ground-20","meta":{}}]}}
