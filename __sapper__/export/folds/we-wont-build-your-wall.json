Rather, we have not only to bring the material urgencies of the body into the square, but to make those needs central to the demands of politics.” (butler, notes toward a performative theory of assembly. 2015 p.96)</p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"","bulletin":true,"publication_date":"2017-02-06","website":"","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22031718/Vol-02-Bulletin_We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_02-06-17.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":1377,"height":891,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-300x194.jpg","width":300,"height":194,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-300x194.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-768x497.jpg","width":768,"height":497,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-768x497.jpg"},"large":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-1024x663.jpg","width":1024,"height":663,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-1024x663.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-1200x776.jpg","width":1200,"height":776,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front-1200x776.jpg"},"full":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front.jpg","width":1377,"height":891,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025555/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_back":{"media_details":{"width":1377,"height":891,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-300x194.jpg","width":300,"height":194,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-300x194.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-768x497.jpg","width":768,"height":497,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-768x497.jpg"},"large":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-1024x663.jpg","width":1024,"height":663,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-1024x663.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-1200x776.jpg","width":1200,"height":776,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back-1200x776.jpg"},"full":{"file":"We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back.jpg","width":1377,"height":891,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22025551/We_Wont_Build_Your_Wall_back.jpg"}}}},"posts":[{"meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Tectonics of Power"},"slug":"tectonics-of-power","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Aslan Taheri"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"ARCHITECTURE AND THE POLITICS OF PISSED (a micro manifesto)"},"slug":"architecture-and-the-politics-of-pissed-a-micro-manifesto","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Mark Foster Gage"}}]}}]}}
