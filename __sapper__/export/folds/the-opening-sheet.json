Today we launch aÂ <strong>Paprika! broadsheet</strong>. A running record to appear on lecture Thursdays, the broadsheet will lay a brisk beat to a now biannual journal (expect Paprika! Issue 3 in September). Still a student run and written publication bound firmly to our present and our place, each week a different issue editor or team of editors will curate its content, highlighting work timely and topical to our community. Find jammed on this sheet the work, thoughts and observations of some forty students, coming together to make sense of the world around us and exchange ideas about what is to come.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"entry-footer\"></footer>\n</article>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"01","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2015-04-02","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22004414/Vol-01-Issue-01_The-Opening-Sheet_Kemper-Sternad-Wan_04-02-15.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":2025,"height":1823,"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22004907/Vol-01-Issue-01_The_Opening_Sheet_Kemper-Sternad_-Wan_04-02_15_front.jpg"}}}}}}
