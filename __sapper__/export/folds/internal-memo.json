It’s a place to explore our experiences and relationship to our pedagogical environment, and a testing ground for what we would do differently – a space to put forward our conflicting ideologies, and rant about our problems.</span></p>\n<p><span>This issue, and the publication as a whole, aims to be the mouth of a student body with ideas worth sharing.
