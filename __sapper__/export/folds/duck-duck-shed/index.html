Their well-known dialogue played out over a series of articles, collectively titled “Cultural Debate: Existing Situation,” published all in the same issue of <em>Casabella</em> in 1971. It went something like this:</p> <p><strong>DSB:</strong> “High style architects are not producing what people want or need.”<a href=#_ftn1 name=_ftnref1>[2]</a></p> <p><strong>KF:</strong> “Once informational/computational processes are emphasized, as they are now, above places of arrival and departure, the very notion of place itself tends to become threatened, to the potential detriment of ‘human’ experience.”<a href=#_ftn1 name=_ftnref1>[3]</a></p> <p><strong>DSB:</strong> “Frampton misses the agony in our acceptance of pop.”<a href=#_ftn1 name=_ftnref1>[4]</a></p> <p>Though nearly fifty years have passed, the arguments on both sides still hold water. Seeing no better way, we take to their depths as a duck, shedding the pretense of adversarial academics in favor of an interplay more at home in the schoolyard than at our desks. In the wake of these scholars, architecture has become both constructed and flat, both place and symbol, simultaneously. So we re-engage the dialogue seeing that we may not have to choose a side, but benefit from playing both. We form a circle, we look each other in the eyes, and we spin around and around until we can no longer remember who is duck, goose, human, or shed.<br> You may ask, “What is the meaning of all of this?” We ask, “What makes architecture meaningful?” Can we build from pop image culture today (memes, mood boards and all), or does our obsession with image still leave the buildings we design short on experience? Is architecture in the digital age truly a “flattened index of images” or has a wormhole formed somewhere along the way that might soon transport us to a very different pond?<br> In search of answers (or maybe just for the love of the game) let’s reconsider Scott Brown and Frampton.
