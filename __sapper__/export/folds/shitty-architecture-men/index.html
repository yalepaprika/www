We printed as many answers as possible, selected to capture the spectrum of opinions expressed. The answers included in the fold represent only a fraction of the total responses we received.

Although we recognize that an anonymous survey can elicit strong language, we believe that a platform that allows for honesty and directness is needed at this moment.
