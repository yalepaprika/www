{"slug":"state-of-the-carpet-bulletin-2020","title":{"rendered":"State of the Carpet Bulletin"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At 7:52 p.m. on March 10</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, Yale President Peter Salovey sends an email notifying the community that University courses will be conducted online following Spring Break, in response to increasing global concern about the spread of COVID-19. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At 3:04 p.m. on March 11</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, Dean Deborah Berke confirms that the School of Architecture will be moving to online instruction until at least April 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, with the majority of access to Rudolph Hall being limited after March 22</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Dean Berke states that the school will reassess the situation during the week of March 30</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, while other schools in the region commit to online instruction through the end of the semester as COVID-19 spreads along the east coast. At 1:53 p.m. on March 14</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, Director of Yale Health Dr. Paul Genecin confirms the first case of COVID-19 within the Yale community, and later that evening, President Salovey extends online instruction to the end of the semester.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, at Rudolph Hall, a team of maintenance staff rips up the old, stained, paprika carpet to be replaced with a “new, brighter shade” [1]</span><span class=\"s1\"> in preparation for the end of the 2019–2020 academic year. A group of seven students, stragglers among a population currently scattered across the globe, watches the process from the 5</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> floor bridge, wondering when and whether they should start packing up their studio desks. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a student-run publication, <i>Paprika!</i> has worked to balance its dual responsibilities of on-the-ground reporting from inside the school and contributions to a broader discourse outside of it. In this spirit, we are using this bulletin to address the “State of the Carpet” at the Yale School of Architecture, to put student voices behind these unprecedented changes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The editorial team has decided to continue as planned with the remaining issues of Volume 05, to be published online as scheduled until on-campus activities resume. We will plan a joint physical release event for any issues published during this period as soon as we regain access to Rudolph Hall. Copies of these issues will also be mailed out to physical subscribers as soon as campus operations resume.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the meantime, we are planning to hold space for 500–800 word opinion pieces in each upcoming issue from current students at the school, to continue discussion as the situation unfolds. If you are interested in contributing to this content, please contact info@yalepaprika.com.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The entire <i>Paprika!</i> team wants to express our concern for everyone affected by the current situation and an ongoing commitment to remaining a voice for the community throughout this time. We’ll be around as long as there is paprika(!) carpet in the fourth floor pit, stained or not.</span></p>\n<p>[1] <span class=\"s1\">@yalearchitecture on Instagram, March 13, 2020.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"5","number":"06","bulletin":true,"publication_date":"2020-03-20","website":"","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220111/Paprika-5-06B.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":2048,"height":1325,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01-150x150.png","width":"150","height":"150","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01-150x150.png"},"medium":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01-300x194.png","width":"300","height":"194","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01-300x194.png"},"medium_large":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01-768x497.png","width":"768","height":"497","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01-768x497.png"},"large":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01-1024x663.png","width":"1024","height":"663","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01-1024x663.png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01-1200x776.png","width":"1200","height":"776","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01-1200x776.png"},"full":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_01.png","width":2048,"height":1325,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220424/Paprika-5-06B_01.png"}}}},"fold_back":{"media_details":{"width":2048,"height":1325,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02-150x150.png","width":"150","height":"150","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02-150x150.png"},"medium":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02-300x194.png","width":"300","height":"194","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02-300x194.png"},"medium_large":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02-768x497.png","width":"768","height":"497","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02-768x497.png"},"large":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02-1024x663.png","width":"1024","height":"663","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02-1024x663.png"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02-1200x776.png","width":"1200","height":"776","mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02-1200x776.png"},"full":{"file":"Paprika-5-06B_02.png","width":2048,"height":1325,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19220442/Paprika-5-06B_02.png"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Angela Lufkin"},"slug":"angela-lufkin"},{"title":{"rendered":"Adam Thibodeaux"},"slug":"adam-thibodeaux"},{"title":{"rendered":"Sarah Weiss"},"slug":"sarah-weiss"},{"title":{"rendered":"Max Wirsing"},"slug":"max-wirsing"}],"coordinating_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Angela Lufkin"},"slug":"angela-lufkin"},{"title":{"rendered":"Max Wirsing"},"slug":"max-wirsing"},{"title":{"rendered":"Sarah Weiss"},"slug":"sarah-weiss"},{"title":{"rendered":"Adam Thibodeaux"},"slug":"adam-thibodeaux"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Milo Bonacci"},"slug":"milo-bonacci"}],"publishers":[{"title":{"rendered":"Liwei Wang"},"slug":"liwei-wang"},{"title":{"rendered":"Morgan Kerber"},"slug":"morgan-kerber"},{"title":{"rendered":"Audrey Tseng Fischer"},"slug":"audrey-tseng-fischer"}],"web_editor":[{"title":{"rendered":"Seth Thompson"},"slug":"seth-thompson"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"Open Call: HOME OFFICE"},"slug":"open-call-home-office","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Rachael Tsai"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Gustav Nielsen"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Diana Smiljkovic"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Jack Rusk"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"In Spite of the New Austerity"},"slug":"in-spite-of-the-new-austerity","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Jack Rusk"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"On the Ground"},"slug":"on-the-ground-76","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Making Friends with My Apartment"},"slug":"making-friends-with-my-apartment","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Angela Lufkin"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Creating Meaning in Isolation"},"slug":"creating-meaning-in-isolation","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Jen Shin"}}]}}]}}
