This issue consists of a series of brief interviews with thinkers and practitioners who engage housing from wildly different vantages— be they conceptual, material, financial, political, or otherwise:</p>\n<p>Housing must be a human right, but still, housing is a commodity (Angotti) / The affordable housing crisis produces the homelessness crisis and the Right to Shelter is not the Right to Housing (Staudenmeier) / You can’t say ‘public housing’ in public without using it in the past tense. Today, private real estate governs, often violently (Martin) / Style is the great equalizer, and sometimes, we need a new image (Plater-Zyberk) / Housing should be a social process related to the collective urban surrounding, not manifest out of our individual dreams (Fezer).</p>\n<p>These perspectives illuminate, undermine, bolster, repeat, and contradict one another. Together, they are in service of each other, and in turn, in service of those seeking to do something about the housing crisis.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"entry-footer\"></footer>\n</article>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"23","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-04-27","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/21234813/Vol-02-Issue-23_Housing_Molloy-Zeif_04-27-17.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011514/Vol-02-Issue-23_Housing_Molloy-Zeif_04-27-17_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Jonathan Molloy"},"slug":"jonathan-molloy"},{"title":{"rendered":"Sam Zeif"},"slug":"sam-zeif"}],"coordinating_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Francesca Carney"},"slug":"francesca-carney"},{"title":{"rendered":"Abena Bonna"},"slug":"abena-bonna"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Rosa McElheny"},"slug":"rosa-mcelheny"},{"title":{"rendered":"Liyan Zhao"},"slug":"liyan-zhao"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"TOM ANGOTTI"},"slug":"tom-angotti","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Tom Angotti"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"REINHOLD MARTIN"},"slug":"reinhold-martin","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Reinhold Martin"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"JESKO FEZER"},"slug":"jesko-fezer","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Jesko Fezer"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"ELIZABETH PLATER-ZYBERK"},"slug":"elizabeth-plater-zyberk","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"ANN MARIE STAUDENMAIER"},"slug":"ann-marie-staudenmaier","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ann Marie Staudenmaier"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"The Problem with the Housing Problem"},"slug":"the-problem-with-the-housing-problem","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Martin Man"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Claiming the Void: observations on shelter in Mumbai"},"slug":"claiming-the-void-observations-on-shelter-in-mumbai","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"David Bruce"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Book Review"},"slug":"book-review","meta":{}}]}}
