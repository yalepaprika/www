Overhead, gusty drafts outdo the icy temperatures of the New Haven winter while coffee stains threaten to turn the unrelenting paprika carpets into a pukey palette. The cancerous blob that is Loria Hall is the only reason Rudolph Hall survives today, hosting bathrooms and elevators, allowing our prophetic architecture to live another day. Despite all this, we­—the obsessive, idealistic, charismatic-yet-neurotic students of this blasphemous field—gawk at the idea of working within this hall.<strong> It Must Be Fetish.</strong> How else could it be explained? We tear up at the sight of a Rudolphian section perspective. At our desks, we ponder our projects with feverish fixations, squinting through the blinding glare of the paprika-colored carpets. We produce without pause, slapping on some concrete texture here (to hell with carbon footprints, it’s beautiful!), throwing in some tropical plants there, working steadily towards our own godly section perspectives.
