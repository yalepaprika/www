Our explorations, dreams, and visions confront the hard fact of deliverables: the requisite plans, sections, models, renderings, and—yes, Hernan—animations we need for our final critiques. Therein is the magic of architecture: to have value, you must build. But of course therein too is the pitfall: practicalities can eat the best thesis alive. So as we approach two finals— studio reviews, and of course the Rudolph Open badminton matchup—do not compromise. Let the minutiae fade away, do not surrender the motivation to mundanities. Do the important thing. In your hands is another final: the last issue of The Paprika! Fold for this semester. Our production entails its own compromises, but we will continue to prize the student perspective. So pitch in, pick a fight, record a moment, make sense of an event. Paprika! is your platform. Stand on it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"03","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2015-04-16","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22004726/Vol-01-Issue-03_The-Final-Countdown_Sternad-Kemper-Singler-Wang_04-16-15.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22004958/Vol-01-Issue-03_The_Final_Countdown_Sternad-Kemper-Singler-Wang_04-16-15_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Andy Sternad"},"slug":"andy-sternad"},{"title":{"rendered":"Nicolas Kemper"},"slug":"nicolas-kemper"},{"title":{"rendered":"Susan Wang"},"slug":"susan-wang"},{"title":{"rendered":"Sofia Singler"},"slug":"sofia-singler"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ben Fehrman-Lee"},"slug":"ben-fehrman-lee"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"Style is Everything"},"slug":"style-is-everything","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Amir Karimpour"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Honky Tonk Angels: Beer.
