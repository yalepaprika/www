What are the alternative paths that one can take? In a time when work is largely produced under the authority of institutions or firms, can agency be reclaimed through independent projects? This fold is an attempt to show that there are possibilities of producing meaningful work at a scale that is accessible to independent pursuits.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"entry-footer\"></footer>\n</article>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"07","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2015-09-18","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22003253/Vol-01-Issue-07_Hands-On_Angel-Booth_09-18-15.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22005216/Vol-01-Issue-07_Hands_On_Angel-Booth_09-18-15_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Dorian Booth"},"slug":"dorian-booth"},{"title":{"rendered":"Jess Angel"},"slug":"jess-angel"}],"coordinating_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Andy Sternad"},"slug":"andy-sternad"},{"title":{"rendered":"Nicolas Kemper"},"slug":"nicolas-kemper"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Martin Bek"},"slug":"martin-bek"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"A Conversation with Kent  Bloomer"},"slug":"a-conversation-with-kent-bloomer","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Interview w/ Peggy Deamer"},"slug":"interview-w-peggy-deamer","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Space with No Brief"},"slug":"space-with-no-brief","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Agile Architecture"},"slug":"agile-architecture","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Super Shelter Manifesto"},"slug":"super-shelter-manifesto","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"As Many as We Want"},"slug":"as-many-as-we-want","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"On the Ground"},"slug":"on-the-ground-5","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Teardrop"},"slug":"teardrop","meta":{}}]}}
