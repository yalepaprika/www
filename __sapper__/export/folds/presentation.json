This issue is centered around the activity which every student spends hours preparing for: Presentations. We are addressing the issue from various points of view. The student body at YSOA has been surveyed to understand studentâ€™s habits and experiences. We have talked to Dean Berke about the importance of presentations in architectural discourse [see Tips from the Dean], and reviewed different models of presentation [see Image 29 &amp; Suggestions]. We have heard your opinions [see Suggestions] and your stories [see Anecdotes], and we are sharing it all here. This issue should be fun and interactive to relieve you of final reviews anxiety, boredom&#8230;.etc. Our aim is that this issue will spark a conversation about our reviews and presentation structures in YSOA and the architecture field as a whole.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"24","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-05-01","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/21235017/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":2025,"height":1823,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-300x270.jpg","width":300,"height":270,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-300x270.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-768x691.jpg","width":768,"height":691,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-768x691.jpg"},"large":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-1024x922.jpg","width":1024,"height":922,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-1024x922.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-1200x1080.jpg","width":1200,"height":1080,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front-1200x1080.jpg"},"full":{"file":"Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front.jpg","width":2025,"height":1823,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22011533/Vol-02-Issue-24_Presentation_Hui-Furman-Cooley_05-01-17_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Cecilia Hui"},"slug":"cecilia-hui"},{"title":{"rendered":"Casey Furman"},"slug":"casey-furman"},{"title":{"rendered":"Dakota Cooley"},"slug":"dakota-cooley"}],"coordinating_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Francesca Carney"},"slug":"francesca-carney"},{"title":{"rendered":"Abena Bonna"},"slug":"abena-bonna"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Hicham Faraj"},"slug":"hicham-faraj"},{"title":{"rendered":"Theresa Liu"},"slug":"theresa-liu"}],"posts":[]}}
