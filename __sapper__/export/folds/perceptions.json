In short, this issue of Paprika! hopes to act as a bridge–a first step towards establishing a forum for a more active dialogue with those outside Rudolph Hall with the goal of ultimately creating a more critical, impactful, and relevant design profession.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"entry-footer\"></footer>\n</article>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"12","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2015-11-05","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22003717/Vol-01-Issue-12_Perceptions_Acheatel-Hardee-Todd_11-05-15.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":2025,"height":1823,"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22005418/Vol-01-Issue-12_Perceptions_Acheatel-Hardee-Todd_11-05-15_front.jpg"}}}}}}
