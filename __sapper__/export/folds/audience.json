{"slug":"audience","title":{"rendered":"Audience"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>When tasked with “rebuilding architecture”, the first question should be “for whom?”.</p>\n<p>As architects, we can agree that everyone has an investment in the fate of the built environment. But this reality is rarely acknowledged outside of our discipline. In a similar vein, architecture draws heavily from other fields; the work of other specialists is critical to our own. But it seems that our work is never instrumental to theirs.</p>\n<p>This <i>Paprika!</i> asks how we can “rebuild” our discourse and our practice by engaging a wider audience to make architecture more valuable to the public and other disciplines. Expanding our audience and operating outside of prescribed models of practice can only strengthen the relevance of our work. Who is this expanded public and what can we learn from them, and vice versa? How do we emphasize that together, as a society, we are <i>all </i>stakeholders in the fate of the built environment? Can we reimagine our practice to become more critical, more relevant and better situated within a broader societal context?</p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"3","number":"11","publication_date":"2018-01-24","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/21232407/2018_0124-PaprikaVol3-11-Audience-v1.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22012208/2018_0124_PaprikaVol3-11_Audience_v1_front.jpg"}}}},"fold_editors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Orli Hakanoglu"},"slug":"orli-hakanoglu"},{"title":{"rendered":"Alejandro Duran"},"slug":"alejandro-duran"}],"graphic_designer":[{"title":{"rendered":"Emma Gregoline"},"slug":"emma-gregoline"}],"web_editor":[{"title":{"rendered":"Seth Thompson"},"slug":"seth-thompson"}],"posts":[{"title":{"rendered":"Letter to the Administration"},"slug":"3767-2","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Local Area News: History Repeating: The Redevelopment of New Haven’s Church Street"},"slug":"local-area-news-history-repeating-the-redevelopment-of-new-havens-church-street","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Jonathan Hopkins"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"The Subversive Architect: Toward a Design Jurisprudence for Revolutionaries"},"slug":"the-subversive-architect-toward-a-design-jurisprudence-for-revolutionaries","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Tyler Crawford"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Architecture and Music"},"slug":"architecture-and-music","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"In Defense of the Introvert"},"slug":"in-defense-of-the-introvert","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"James Coleman"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"On The Ground"},"slug":"on-the-ground-45","meta":{}},{"title":{"rendered":"Rebuilding Rebuilding"},"slug":"rebuilding-rebuilding","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Wes Hiatt"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Architecture and Public Health"},"slug":"architecture-and-public-health","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ashton Gores"}}]}},{"title":{"rendered":"Interview with Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman"},"slug":"interview-with-teddy-cruz-and-fonna-forman","meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Alejandro Duran"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Orli Hakanoglu"}}]}}]}}
