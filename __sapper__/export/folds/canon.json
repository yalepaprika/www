{"slug":"canon","title":{"rendered":"Ca(non)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>This issue puts into question the architectural “canon,” a term that is often used but not explicitly defined. Our intention is neither to define nor defy it but instead to address the implications of the term on what is taught, how architecture is practiced, and who gets recognized. In this issue, we deliberately bring to the foreground resources that represent architecture’s historic and contemporary heterogeneity. This acknowledgment is necessary in reflecting the larger shift towards diversifying architectural pedagogy and the imperatives of contemporary practice.</p>\n"},"meta":{"volume":"4","number":"15","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2019-04-04","website":"","pdf":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/03114630/Canon-final-1crop21.pdf"},"fold_front":{"media_details":{"width":1000,"height":900,"sizes":{"full":{"source_url":"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/03115044/Canon-finalbw.jpg"}}}}}}
