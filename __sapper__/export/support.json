{"content":{"rendered":"<p><b><i>Paprika!</i></b><b> is a broadsheet published by the students of the Yale School of Architecture</b><span>. The publication takes its name from the bold shade of orange carpeting in Rudolph Hall, the epicenter of student life at YSoA.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Paprika!</i></b><b> seeks to empower and encourage critical discourse among the student body.</b><span> Each fold is edited by a new team of student editors, representing all degree programs and years at the school. Editors curate content under a theme of their choosing, receiving contributions from faculty, students, and staff at YSoA, all the while reaching out beyond </span><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span>’s roots in Rudolph Hall to engage with the campus, profession, and discipline at large. Our publication provides an essential and timely outlet for student voices to contribute to a larger discussion. </span><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> is published on Thursdays, aligning with the school’s lecture series, and has proved instrumental in establishing a relationship between YSoA, the Yale School of Art, and the Yale School of Management. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Paprika!</i></b><b> is now entering its fifth year in print.</b><span> Since its inception in 2014, 66 folds have been published, with an additional nine slated for the spring of 2019. Rooted in the prideful principle of autonomy and independence from our home institution, the Yale School of Architecture, </span><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> receives no fiscal support from the school. We need your help to bring these folds to life!</span></p>\n"}}
