I have said this before: The gender issue is a huge problem, but it’s the tip of the iceberg of a much larger problem. Architecture does not look like the population. We do not have enough women, we do not have enough people of color, we do not have enough people of varying  backgrounds. And that needs to change. How does it change? It has to change in kindergarten. Forget the common core curriculum. People and children need to be taught not only the significance of the built environment, but also their ability to make and shape it. If we could start doing that – broad diversity would achieve itself, of course, over an extended period of time.

I would love to know the numbers in other fields because I believe women across the field feel that having children puts them at a disadvantage, and I do not think this is unique to architecture actually. I think there are other issues present within architecture that are not relevant to other fields. I think the issue of having a child is not up to us. We must respect the individual’s decision to have children or not. It is an issue when women feel forced to make that decision. I think the issues for women within architecture go beyond balancing parenthood.  Rather, the issues are actually death by a thousand cuts. It’s everyday and every way in which being a woman in a job that men are expected to hold is a problem. It wears you down. Architecture pays so poorly that it is a struggle to afford childcare in order to resume work. It is not just a child issue, it is also a wage issue, it’s a whole ton of issues. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>P: Does your firm have measures in place to ensure a family-friendly environment, irrespective of gender? </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>DB: My firm does have measures in place. We have parental leave. Even for adopted children. We must also consider what is fair to other family arrangements such as caring for an elderly parent. It’s more about how to accommodate the outsides lives of the people who work in your office, in a field that is not particularly profitable and very competitive. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>P: There is a dearth of women-led firms, and even so, the couple/partner model still prevails.

I came from a middle-class background– my parents didn’t have connections to provide me with clients. So it was a very very slow process. But there are other ways to do it.
