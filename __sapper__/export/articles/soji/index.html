Our studio culture celebrates work heroically, and incapable workers are viewed with an unwarranted disdain. We believe that the number of hours we invest directly relates to how much we learn, though this often results in us being too tired or too sick to retain information.

What impacted me more was working in that strange, surreal environment.

I realized that it is through this ridiculous dedication to work that the Japanese develop spaces with such ineffable sensibility.</p> <p>I left my well-paying job in Hong Kong to pursue those internships. Was that a foolish move? Certainly from an economic perspective, but there was so much I would not have gained had I stayed in Hong Kong. All of us who are taking/have taken Intro to Planning know that, in the real world, our profession is controlled by money. But perhaps we all hope deep down that it isn’t so. After all, I chose architecture as a career precisely because I did not want to work in a cubicle for thirty years.</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
