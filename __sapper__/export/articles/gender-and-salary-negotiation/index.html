In speaking to friends in the profession, it is concerning how few women are in leadership roles at many architecture firms, and the number of women who are licensed is equally concerning. Being conscious of this gap, and paying attention to women’s’ fulfillment of leadership and management roles can speak volumes about a firm. Regardless, the percent gap in pay between genders in 2004-2014 remained consistent, with a 9-11.5% difference between men and women in the industry.
