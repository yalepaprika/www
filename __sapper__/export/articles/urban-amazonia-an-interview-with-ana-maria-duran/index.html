In a conversation last week, we discussed the urban character of Amazonia and the politics of resource extraction in the forest. The full interview coming soon.</em></p> <p><strong>Blanca Begert:</strong> <em>Brazilian geographer Bertha Becker called Amazonia a “foresta urbana,” an “urban forest.” Even knowing that there are over 33 million people living in Amazonia, it’s still surprising to hear this region referred to as an urban forest. What do you think of this characterization?</em></p> <p><strong>Ana María Durán:</strong> The first time I understood there were cities in the Amazon was when I went to Manaus when I was 15 years old. We stayed in a hotel at the edge of the city and that edge marked me. It’s not like this everywhere in the city, but at that instance it was a manichaeic, hard edge of forest and city, brutally disarticulated from each other. Having grown up with this idea of Amazonia as a pristine wilderness, I was shocked. This was a huge city in the middle of Amazonia, full of industrial sites. </p> <p>The urban history of Amazonia goes all the way back into pre-colonial times. One of the more recent chapters during which Amazonian cities prospered was during the first industrial revolution in England, when the demand for latex soared. The rubber tree is endemic to the Amazon and at the end of the 19th century Amazonia was the only area where latex existed. Imagine all tributaries of the Amazon basin suddenly becoming these hinterland economies that each have a system of cities in place, and an entrepot, a collection point for trade, where you meet the Amazon. </p> <p>It was the first pan-Amazonian extractive system, analogous to what is happening with other extractive systems now. It was brutal there. Indigenous communities everywhere were being enslaved to tap rubber. We’re still living the same story. The resource is different, but you still have systems of slavery, immense violence, abuse, accumulation, the barons in Latin America, and the beneficiaries in other empires. Once the rubber plant was bio-pirated, and taken by the British to the colonies in Southeast Asia, these economies in the Amazon collapsed—but what a relief for Amazonians. </p> <p><strong>B:</strong> <em>In Jim Scott’s Agrarian Societies class, we talked about how the state relies on simplified, knowable units to govern. Can you talk a little bit about the relationship between the state and Amazonia?</em></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Jim Scott’s book Against the Grain has been so helpful for me in terms of understanding Amazonia and the non-panoptic vision. I think Amazonia has such a negative relationship with the state because you cannot control it. In order to apply visual control mechanisms, you have to destroy the forest. Bolsonaro has tried to do this. But if you destroy it, you fall down with it. The resource appraisals we do in Amazonia are all about our ability to see it from above with satellites. But the Amazon is non-Foucauldian. It’s not a panopticon. </p> <p>Amazonia drives the state crazy. Any loophole the state creates is countered by some resistance, some structure that the state doesn’t know how to deal with. It’s the condition of the forest. The canopy is not a site for visual power. It’s a place for sounds, spatiality, water, it’s a different kind of place. There is a local knowledge of water routes that is beyond our access. Amazonia defies the West and our systems at every level, that’s why we crack down there.</p> <p><strong>B:</strong> <em>We talk about informal cities and you refer to them in quotes. Is “informal” not the right way to be thinking of these cities?</em></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s hard to name it. Informal means lacking form, and that’s not the case with these cities. Latin American scholars tend to prefer “auto-construido” which means “self-built:” the city that is built by all the people who have not been incorporated into the capitalist systems and are not part of the market or the state. Mike Davis calls them the “surplus” humanity. I’m not sure if I like that term, because he’s looking at it from the center outwards, though of course he is using it in a very cynical, Marxist way, to critique capitalism.<br> People refer to “frontier cities.” Here I give credit to Susanna Hecht, who once said to me, “Frontier? From whose perspective?” We’re advancing into Amazonia so it’s a frontier of extraction, the oil frontier, the soybean agribusiness frontier. But from the perspective of indigenous peoples it is not a frontier at all, it’s an invasion. </p> <p>“Frontier” needs to be questioned as a concept urgently because it has to do with jurisdiction, land tenure, and security. Indigenous populations are being dispossessed once again because our ontologies don’t take them into account. They don’t have the same property system as us. We try to impose ours and kick them out. It’s a continuous clash. So many people die in Amazonia every month due to land conflicts. In the abstract world, the market is this benign mechanism of exchange. On the ground, it has a brutal, violet, geopolitical side. Just look at the article by Judith Kimerling for the Vermont Law Review—the oil companies were throwing bombs from the air into Waorani settlements to open the ground for extraction. </p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
