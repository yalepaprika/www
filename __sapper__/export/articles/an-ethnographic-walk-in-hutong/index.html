Empty is a suitable word to describe the place. Besides several cars passing by, there are only a few people struggling to hail taxis. Robert Venturi once said “Learning from the existing landscape is a way of being revolutionary for an architect.” I ask myself: as an architect, can I learn from this particular “landscape” or is there something that can be revolutionary? The freshly-painted white fences divide the street into isolated parcels to stop pedestrians from crossing the road for “safety reasons.” Faint smells of paint and exhaust mix together in my lungs. Across the road, a bulldozer is rumbling. The place used to be a quite dense hutong neighborhood. Now the life here is gone. Only two houses remain. “Quite lonely,” I say to myself. Among this vast land of ruin in the city center, both the bulldozer and the houses it intends to demolish seem miserably tiny.

I turn right again and finally dive into the hutong neighborhood that I was searching for. In contrast to the enormous road, this intimate space is perfect for walking. It’s around five meters wide, a dimension that puts a car at risk of getting stuck in certain corners. If <em>Learning from Las Vegas</em> suggests “big spaces, high speeds” and “an architecture of bold communication rather than subtle expression,”[1] the space here is about narrowness and enclosure, moving slowly with speeds of 30-meters-per-minute. A walk in a hutong reveals subtle textures that can only be discerned if one reads with enough proximity and attention.<br> I look around. Two walls of grey brick frame the space. Windows punctuate the “frame” with a constant rhythm. They are the expressions of life behind the wall, the life within those subdivided and high-density siheyuan. Standing on tiptoes, one might accidentally get a glimpse of people’s living rooms or kitchens. Sometimes, windows are covered with translucent curtains or carefully decorated with lace, to prevent accidental visual intrusions while allowing light to enter the interior. Noises and voices are leaking from individual households’ window, and doorways.

The fact is that in the hutong, building forms and walls do not set the definition for space, as the edges are easily blurred by apertures, sounds, smells, and the individuals’ modifications on details. Multiple dimensions of spatial practices aggregate in this single alleyway. As I am walking, I find the lines between them are rather difficult to draw. They vary all the time, just like the ever-changing zone between riverbank and riverbed.<br> Perhaps, in hutong, due to the density and the relative freedom from strict building regulations, I begin to understand space differently. It is the residents’ behavioral patterns that overpower the building forms here. The brick courtyard walls, gables, and tiled roofs sink into the background, becoming the invisible stage for the dramas of daily life. During my short walk, the framed alley has already changed its functions as its users and their “props” change.</p> <p>As the journey continues, I realize the hutong is not merely the space for ventilation or circulation as it was originally planned in Yuan Dynasty, nor is it a commercial space like the other streets nearby.

In one corner, wires and climbing plants extend from individual households. They organically cover the mottled pilasters of the wall. Consequently, they become the essential infrastructure and texture of the hutong. Clothes and bedding are hung on the wire, with its one end tied to the wall and the other tied to a pole.
