They explained what was expected of him: an eighth-scale basswood model built entirely by hand. The process was what he enjoyed most: building pieces of the model, reviewing them with Tod and Billie, rebuilding, all the while learning more about the thing they were making as it was being made.

The largest Channel Island has plenty of the former strewn across its 9 by 5 miles that have survived six decades of coastal abuse. The island also features severe winter storms with winds up to 30 mph — a summer visit is better. Ms. Lopez thanks the Harvey Geiger Winter Travel Fellowship for the experience that has supported her research of the repurposed bunkers and their cultural role on the Channel Islands, and returns to California chilled but inspired.</p> <p>01/11/16: AMRA SARIC (B.A. ‘17) traveled to Spain with the Harvey Geiger Winter Travel Fellowship on a quest to uncover the secrets of spolium, the repurposing of architectural fragments for new construction. Looking at Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia as ideological spolium, and the Mosque of Cordoba as material spolium, she expanded upon adopting adapted concepts for design, and adapting adopted programs over time. Her project investigated the century-long construction of Sagrada Familia, and the multifarious site of the Mosque of Cordoba, from its underground remnants of a Roman and Visigothic temple to the Gothic cathedral planted in the Mosque’s center. Did they call it ‘adaptive reuse’ in the 7th century as well?</p> <p> </p> <p>GROUNDING THE CRITICS</p> <p>Spring 2016 begins with resolutions, ultimatums, and directives. We compare this spring’s lineup to some of the critics’ past teaching endeavors. ZAHA HADID and PATRICK SCHUMACHER move to the city because “remaining provincial is not an option.” It looks like students will be co-tending an urban terrarium of dense correlations and associations, eventually producing “rich, navigable diversity.” HADID has experience in the field; her Fall 2014 studio at the Institute of Architecture, Vienna, explored extensions to the London design museum using transformative biological organizations.</p> <p>KERSTEN GEERS and CAITLIN TAYLOR are traveling in the opposite direction to look for a new commons in the countryside. The 19th iteration of “Architecture without Content” will lay siege to our antiquated notions of the American village — according to them “the stakes are high, but the weapons of choice are relatively simple. It is purely a matter of precision.” The previous 17 campaigns have battled with big boxes, difficult doubles, and Palladio at our kindred acronyms: EPFL, GSD, GSAPP. We can’t find 18.</p> <p>“Property demands commitment,” wrote HANS KOLLHOFF and KYLE DUGDALE who contend that the European skyscraper is not simply an extrusion of the site propelled by property values, but rather a vertical extension of the earth. They will test the limits of Berlin’s Alexanderplatz through the design of twelve towered urban blocks. KOLLHOFF previously led studios at ETH Zurich that imagined hotels for a square in Trieste and Campo dei Fiori and is currently working on the revival of Schinkel’s Bauakademie in Berlin.</p> <p>WOLF PRIX has intrigued us with a brief of many parts: an information building for a future society of overlapping innovations, somehow thematically involved with water, becoming a vessel that serves as a structure for knowledge.
