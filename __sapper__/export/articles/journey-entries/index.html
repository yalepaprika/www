If, pray tell, I *don’t* Zoom into that digital lecture or Q&A, am I missing out?

Certainly the quality of school is lower after the quarantine, but the pressure to do work in a certain way or for a certain amount of time has faded quite a bit from the pressure cooker that is Rudolph Hall. I feel more free to work the way I want to work now that I’m away from school.</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Sarah)<br> </b><i><span>New Haven</span></i></p> <p><span>My studio project lives in the computer. It is stuck in there! I am constantly trying to conceive of its spaces in terms of feet. At Rudolph Hall I used the bridge, which I paced out to be about 35 ft. I have been trying to remember what that distance felt like but every week it gets harder. Today I paced the longest dimension of my living room: window to wall = 15 ft. I multiply it many times to feel the sense of a larger space.</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Anonymous)<br> </b><i><span>New Haven</span></i></p> <p><span>I guess if there aren’t any internships or jobs or real career opportunities, I can always crawl into a hole in the ground and wait this thing out. Maybe it’s like, having dug the foundation of the BP house, there’s no concrete truck left working to fill it. So instead of inhabiting the house, I can hang out in the pit. And maybe we all have a pit in the place of our education and can find ways to continue living. Sometimes we’ll visit each other. “Hey, nice pit. I love what you’ve done with the place.” Generally, we will locate a person’s foundation pit by its general size and disposition, alleviating the need for addresses and other abstractions. The unfilled foundations of our education are like the empty swimming pools of Venice, CA, in the 1970s. But all they got was skateboarding and we risk discovering much more.</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Caroline)<br> </b><i><span>Madison, New Jersey</span></i></p> <p><span>The fact that I have nowhere else to be, no commute and no time difference, yet STILL show up late to class on Zoom, means there is literally no hope for my chronic tardiness.</span><b></b></p> <hr> <p><b>(Anonymous)<br> </b><i><span>New Haven</span></i></p> <p><span>occasional anxiety attacks, otherwise fine / stuck in the same crappy living space , more stuck than ever / zoom is like any other learning tool : chalkboard , projection , voice , text , image — better for some than others — i am having trouble concentrating on, processing, and retaining information and concepts / to be obliged to do work with the necessary tools intentionally withheld is worse than having no work at all / isolation and anxiety make it difficult to even remember that my community exists / my mental health is not well. yale mental health was inadequate before the crisis, and is even worse now / a policeman threatened me with a citation for ‘jogging’ in east rock yesterday<br> </span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Sarah Kim)<br> </b><i><span>Los Angeles</span></i></p> <p><span>Attempting to connect with people during isolation is starting to feel emotionally expensive. Social distancing is showing me a hundred ways to injure myself with the desire for closeness. Wasn’t it always like this, pre-COVID? In Rudolph we’d stay awake until dawn, clicking and cutting and gluing until our bodies hurt, the taste of crummy deli coffee on our breaths, reduced by fatigue, stretched out like putty, our thoughts made all scribbly, all of us together but really alone. The ugly truth of architecture school is an open secret we’ve all agreed to keep. A communal performance of virtuous workaholism that we love to joke about. The hustle hurts, and it grinds, and we carry on. An incorrigible case of the fuck-its for you and me and all of us.

Is architectural equipment creating new potential disasters for our buildings? Elevators become a “petri dish” for the virus. Central air conditioning helps to spread the virus by increasing the airflow among rooms. These are conveniences and we can hardly live without them; however, they can become the accomplices of an epidemic. Should more people participate in the design process besides architects and engineers -for example, epidemiologists- to avoid building disasters in the post-COVID-19 era?<br> </span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Christina Zhang)</b></p> <p><span>Year 2020, since the first quarantine order on January 23, millions of people around the world have been put under quarantine at home. When a domestic place is turned into a quarantine space, basic human rights are being compromised for the sake of public health. Then, when we are physically separated from the ones we love – in our everyday domestic life – how do we address the minimal but eternal need to reach out, to touch, to connect, to care and to be cared, and to feel surrounded by the world? </span></p> <p><span>Through a series of air lock partitions shaped around objects and bodies, we’re connecting even when we are physically separated.</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Anonymous)<br> </b><i><span>Florida</span></i></p> <p><span>It’s been interesting to see the varying levels of faith students have in the faculty and administration of both YSoA and Yale as a whole. It seems that a significant amount of stress could be lifted if we as students genuinely trusted that our best interests were at the heart of the school–so how do we establish a stronger sense of trust in the YSoA and Yale communities?</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Anonymous)<br> </b><i><span>West Coast</span></i></p> <p><span>“COVID-19, however, is a “double-functioning element:” a harsh reality and a gentle wake-up call. It has revealed the educational strengths and uncovered the institutional failures. Namely, the Building Project. Building Project, like the architecture industry, recreates the power dynamics of white colonial america. Our education is a speculative practice that has the capacity to re-envision and reimagine the future of architecture. What would an intersectional building environment look like? We will only know when YSoA approaches race with the same vitality as their commitment to closing the gender gap. When ALL women, including black women, latina women, and indigenous women, are priorities in our recruitment and retention efforts. COVID-19 has revealed the racist and sexist underbelly of YSoA, unattributable to anyone in particular but an institution that sleepwalks towards equity. After this pandemic, “there is no return to sleepwalking.”- Cornel West</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Anonymous)<br> </b><i><span>New Haven</span></i></p> <p><span>Thoughts for the therapist I don’t have: </span></p> <p><span>My relationship with one of my parents changed dramatically in the past year, to the point that this parent doesn’t know my address. This parent has past episodes of respiratory medical history. I’m trying to balance the justification of the anger, disappointment, and loss of trust that led to my distancing of this relationship, knowing that if they get sick and don’t recover, god forbid, we will not have spent the time resolving the issues we need to, and how that would break my heart. </span></p> <p><span>Changing economic situations might lead to a loss of income for my partner’s family. In this case we would need to step in and help out financially. I’m worried about what footing this puts us on in terms of being able to also pay for our living expenses on top of education expenses, while maintaining emergency savings to help cover costs in case my partner’s work hours get cut back or, god forbid, they are let go because of the economic implications of the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>I worry that I’m not talking to family and friends enough during this time while trying to keep up with a “normal” schedule. Internal debates about balancing gestures to the world outside of me vs. grinding on for the future. </span></p> <p><span>Shifting scales, I’m worried that after all of this is over societies will go back to the way they were and won’t take the time to reflect on what this time means. I wonder what could be worth so many people feeling like they can’t get what they need to stay afloat during this pandemic. Money? Power? Security? Continuity? It is a shame our systems are set up to be so reliant on these elements, forcing people to make choices they shouldn’t have to to survive, while simultaneously knowing that these traits are at the root of so many problems.</span></p> <hr> <p><b>(Sangji Han)<br> </b><i><span>New Haven</span></i></p> <p><span> </span><b>Mar 10</b><b>th:</b><span> I fly into LA.
