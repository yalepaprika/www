Presumably timed with the opening the 2017 Venice Architecture Biennale, the show up at the time was on the architecture of Frank Gehry. Joining a crowd of mostly older and impossibly tan Europeans, it was the nightmare of what I thought Venice would be like: repetitive studio models— Gehrian piles taped atop programmatic elements—sat mere feet away from thousand-dollar leather handbags.

Also the recipient of last year’s Pritzker Prize, Aravena is perhaps best known for the Quinta Monroy low-income housing project, which is now frequently invoked in discussions around the kind of “informal” settlement that the architecture world loves to mention when it talks about South America, suggesting Aravena might be an anti-Gehry of sorts. His selection seems intended to send a pointed message: This Biennale would be different, reflecting the impulse towards social consciousness that has peppered architectural discourse these past few years. The main exhibition spaces of the Biennale on the theme “On the Front” are littered with occasionally innovative projects from around the globe which have some kind of “informal” aspect. (Low-cost houses in the American South produced by Rural Studio seems to have been the only project exhibited by a U.S. architectural outfit).

Within an institution like the Biennale, what would change look like? Is it even desirable?

Instead the Canadians issued a nicely-designed zine about mining in their country and the Brits had a cute pavilion filled with inflatable balls you could sit in and a giant bed popularly referred to as “the orgy bed.” Would a focus on human-centered and socially-equitable design mean a turn away from buildings altogether, giving credence to Shumaker’s critique of a discipline that confuses itself with humanitarianism?<br> Many of the European pavilions tackled The Refugee Problem, including a German Pavilion which also exhibited almost no architecture at all, instead focusing on the social programs of German cities in absorbing huge sums of refugees fleeing the xx and other conflicts.

The pavilion raises many provocative questions, including one about the representation of ethnic groups without nationhood at an event which so privileges the role of the nation state.
