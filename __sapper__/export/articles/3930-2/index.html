Plays—and by extension most artifacts of creative production—contain clues to their own resolution. We often personify inanimate things in theatre. For example, when evaluating the possibilities for something (say a set piece, paint treatment, or prop) we ask “what does it want to be?” This phrase performs a couple of important functions. Firstly, it removes our individual opinions from consideration, creating an objective way to see the question. Secondly, it re-focuses our attention on the uniqueness of the thing. Most importantly, it recognizes that material artifacts have a willpower of their own. By asking “what does it want to be?” we trust that the thing will guide us to the best story it can tell.</p> <p>This line of thinking is not new to architecture, of course. From structural expressionism (what does a truss do best?) to Kahn’s treatment of a brick (“even a brick wants to be something. It aspires. Even a common, ordinary brick wants to be something more than it is<a href=#_ftn2 name=_ftnref2><sup>[2]</sup></a>”) architects have evoked a similar mysticism in their work. Perhaps the theatre reminds us that this way of thinking can be generative. Animation can drive the conception of a project and imbue it with a certain richness.</p> <p>Stage design is fundamentally an interpretive enterprise. Unlike many other creative practitioners who engender everything from the ground up, set designers work from a script that already has shape, form, and content. “You start with the script—that thing that you’ve got in your hand that everybody has,” explains designer Jon Bausor, “and you interpret it together.<a href=#_ftn3 name=_ftnref3><sup>[3]</sup></a>”</p> <p>I’ve often wondered if there is a script in architecture. The chief advantage of the script, it seems to me, is how it establishes the subject of the work. The script is the focal point; we measure everything else by its success at telling the story. Lately, I have been interested in interpretation as a design approach in architecture. Architects may not have scripts, per se, but we work with other types of source material that can be interpreted: sites, lots, geological matter, history, infrastructure. What would happen if we treated these as texts connected to other texts, rich with symbolism, structured in narrative forms, resonant with themes, and laced with stories?  How would that inform the architecture we make?</p> <p>Robert Edmond Jones explains that the “designer must strive to achieve what I call a high potential … [it is] a strange, paradoxical calling, to work always behind and around, to bring into being a powerful non-being.<a href=#_ftn4 name=_ftnref4><sup>[4]</sup></a>”  He refers to the fundamental paradox of our work as designers: materializing things that do not have physical presence—ideologies, critiques, celebrations, stories. These exist only as potentials in our world. We have to tap, manifest, and express them in our work. How do we find them? Perhaps close-reading is a good place to start.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=#_ftnref1 name=_ftn1><sup>[1]</sup></a> Fuchs, Elinor. “Visit to a Small Planet: Some Questions to Ask a Play.” MIT Press. &lt;<a href=http://web.mit.edu/jscheib/Public/foundations_06/ef_smallplanet.pdf>http://web.mit.edu/jscheib/Public/foundations_06/ef_smallplanet.pdf</a>></p> <p><a href=#_ftnref2 name=_ftn2><sup>[2]</sup></a> Kahn, Louis. “Louis Kahn Talks to a Brick.”  ArchDaily.
