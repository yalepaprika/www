{"title":{"rendered":"Health Hazards of YSoA"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Are you looking to get out of studio for a couple days? Follow this step by step guide, and you&#8217;ll be on your way out of YSoA and getting that doctor&#8217;s note in no time. You may experience sneezing, wheezing, coughing, fever, headaches, nausea, allergies, inflammation, and rock bottom self-confidence in the process. For the complete list, please refer to the drawing.</p>\n<p>1. Mismanage Your Stress<br />\nKeep your cortisol levels high. Stay stressed and your immune system will go on vacation, letting the flu and colds make a new home in your body.</p>\n<p>2. Breathe In Lots Of Chemicals<br />\nLaser cut lots of acrylic, use only the strongest epoxies, cast resin in studio. It’s only courteous to share the fumes. Make sure to never use a dust mask or respirators with P95 particulate filters and organic vapor cartridges. These keep your lungs nice and pink, and we don&#8217;t want that.</p>\n<p>3. Spend Every Waking Hour Of Your Day In An Airtight Building Filled With Said Chemicals<br />\nTo hell with natural ventilation and outside air. Recirculated air is where it’s at.</p>\n<p>4. Cut Foam In Studio<br />\nYou see that smoke coming off the wire cutter? That&#8217;s styrene gas, potentially carcinogenic, and smells great! Use it in a poorly ventilated corner of studio for maximum effect.</p>\n<p>5. Have A Smoke<br />\nIt’s a great social activity.</p>\n<p>6. Be Sedentary And Order UberEats<br />\nWhy walk to the local salad shop? You deserve chicken nuggets and a greasy burger.</p>\n<p>7. Avoid A Hygienic Studio Space<br />\nWashing your hands after going to the washroom only takes time away from studio. Use spray paint and spray glue in studio. Keep the studio space dirty and dusty.</p>\n<p>8. Mental Health?<br />\nWhat’s that?</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6371\" src=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2032\" srcset=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA.jpg 2000w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA-295x300.jpg 295w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA-768x780.jpg 768w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA-1008x1024.jpg 1008w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06150231/HazardsofYSoA-1200x1219.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" /></p>\n<p>01 Spray paint fumes<br />\n02 Becoming a target<br />\n03 Self-esteem issues<br />\n04 Getting dropped from a keg stand<br />\n05 Toxic masculinity<br />\n06 Vitamin D deficiency on the bridge<br />\n07 Anything on the undergraduate balcony<br />\n08 Lack of sleep<br />\n09 Casting resin in studio<br />\n10 Overheating on the fifth floor<br />\n11 Stress-induced smoking<br />\n12 Making friends with the mice<br />\n13 Coming late to Bob’s class<br />\n14 Angry email from Phil Bernstein<br />\n15 Bumping your head on the stairs<br />\n16 Getting locked out<br />\n17 Mushroom cocktails<br />\n18 When your TF doesn’t bail you out in Formal analysis<br />\n19 Getting caught by Richard bringing coffee into Hastings<br />\n20 Carbon fiber experiments<br />\n21 Breathing Wood dust<br />\n22 Breathing concrete and plaster dust<br />\n23 Poor lifting technique<br />\n24 Getting caught not wearing protective eyewear<br />\n25 Sharp objects in the shop<br />\n26 Returning too many library books at once<br />\n27 Awkward small talk at Career Fair<br />\n28 Getting your next statement from the financial office<br />\n29 Catching the flu<br />\n30 Only drinking Soylent for a week<br />\n31 Ending up with the dungeon desk<br />\n32 Spraining ankle/stepping on pins during badminton<br />\n33 Forgetting to save your work<br />\n34 Laser cutter offgassing<br />\n35 Getting lost in the matrix of screens<br />\n36 Getting supervised at 6 on 7<br />\n37 Eating too much bread at the Bauhaus party<br />\n38 Haunting by the ghost of Paul Rudolph<br />\n39 Sitting in a Gehry chair for more than 10 minutes<br />\n40 Foam Cutter Fumes<br />\n41 Freezing on the seventh floor<br />\n42 3-d printer fumes<br />\n43 Food poisoning from eating moldy food<br />\n44 Attempting to use the bathrooms the weekend before finals<br />\n45 Scalded by near-boiling water</p>\n<p>Model by Jack Lipson, M.Arch I 2018</p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Winston Yuen"},"slug":"winston-yuen","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2019"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Christopher Tritt"},"slug":"christopher-tritt","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2019"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Just What the Doctor Ordered: Health and Architecture"},"meta":{"volume":"4","number":"11","publication_date":"2019-02-07"}}}}
