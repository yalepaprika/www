What strange forces might these manuscripts hold? Ought we be fearful of unleashing their ancient wisdom?

James are great for thinking about the relationship between the text-object and the kinds of power that it might have. He was the provost of Eton College in the early 20th century, a very tweedy man who wrote ghost stories about a scholar, antiquarian, or cataloguer who in some way ends up with a manuscript that has a kind of spectral life. And they’re always set in these particularly charged spaces: the library, or the church, or the gentry household. </span></p> <p><span>Often there’s a kind of spatial narrative – much like you see in these horror stories – surrounding certain texts. They’re unleashed from innocuous circumstances, like the chest in the corner, and then acquire their own life.</span></p> <p><i><span>Can an ancient text still retain its aura when it’s in such a pristine, modern space like the Beinecke?</span></i></p> <p><span>The architecture does contradict the working life of the library. You have this statement from 1963, but the library itself is a laboratory. The tremendous energy that is at work here is in many ways at odds with the building’s appearance of tranquility. The manuscripts are living objects; they’re still used as text, as evidence and we now also increasingly see them as material structures that connect to a remote textual past. </span></p> <p><span>One of the objects in the collection that reminds me of this is Thomas More’s annotated prayer book from when he was held in the Tower of London before his execution. On the one hand it’s interesting as a historical document, but then there’s also the aura of the book – its emotional or affective significance. The Tower of London and More’s execution have no bearing on this book as a physical object, and yet they surround the book intellectually as you encounter it. So I have had this question: why do books that were written in moments of extremis – when the author is in prison or about to die – seem to be granted this additional power? How does a book become a carrier of this emotional charge?</span></p> <p><i><span>Do you get a lot of seekers here – people whose interest feels less than purely scholarly, who want to see an object like this to attain these hidden energies, so to speak?</span></i></p> <p><span>There is often a pilgrimage aspect to research. It’s intensely impassioned. I had this terrible experience at Cambridge at the Fitzwilliam Museum. M.R. James worked there, actually, and it’s this 19th-century space, formal and almost fictional in its English gentlemanliness. The manuscript of Virginia Woolf’s <em>A Room of </em>One’s<em> Own</em> is housed there, and I visited to see this. When the librarians brought it out to the reading room – I had no idea this was going to happen – as soon as I started reading her handwriting I heard her voice in my head, and just burst into tears. And not in a decorous way, but this huge, loud, coughing sob. The entire library had this quality of shocked silence.

James story an allegory for that connection?</span></i></p> <p><span>The figure of the ineffectual scholar, antiquarian, or cataloguer who is always chasing after ghosts comes up often, both in reality and in fiction. For example, take the Shakespeare scholar Delia Bacon. She was obsessed with the idea that Francis Bacon was the author of Shakespeare’s works, to the point that she went to Stratford to try to open Shakespeare’s grave and prove that he wasn’t buried there at all. She actually spent the night in the church, but couldn’t bring herself to excavate the grave. She was haunted by Shakespeare and his absence.

Horace Walpole’s</span><i><span> The Castle of Otranto</span></i><span>, which was the first gothic novel, centers around a lost manuscript that shows up in a tower. Jane Austen’s </span><i><span>Northanger Abbey</span></i><span> is similar: the heroine looks to find what she’s read in a gothic novel. </span></p> <p><i><span>Why this constant searching?
