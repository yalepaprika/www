As the surveyed become the surveyors, </span><span>we find ourselves to be slightly more critical than exuberant. We have the intent to subtly suggest our own opinions and critiques of the school, by posing our questions in a way that makes students think about how they see their upcoming architectural education. Finally, we seek to probe for the overarching culture of the incoming class, while attaining a sense of the architectural ideologies and aspirations of individuals. These responses represent MArch I Class of 2018.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How do you define &#8216;good&#8217; architecture?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>While somewhat of a cliché, each building truly does tell a story, a manifestation of the innumerable considerations that shape how we as humans organize space.  &#8216;Good&#8217; architecture is able to synthesize these factors in a way that meets not only certain demands but ultimately does so to improve the experience of people who interact with the building. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Matthew Shaffer, MArch 1, University of Pittsburgh/Universidad de Alcalá de Henares, Lewisburg PA</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>Good architecture is the beautiful articulation of the efficient. It is the thoughtful convergence of material poetics with daily pragmatics. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>&#8211; Amanda Iglesias, Wheaton College, Washington DC</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What do you think the role of the architect is / should be?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>To sew up and mend the ugly wounds of divisive and polarizing conflicts in culture and society through intelligent design.

S/he must actively engage the local community to achieve regenerative solutions that educate, empower, and enhance lives. Ideas are effects of social institutions but have reflexively productive realities. Thus, through awareness and conscious effort, I believe the architect has the power to redefine social and environmental paradigms. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Caitlin Baiada, Cornell University, NYC</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>To curate a space in service of a community.

However, the status quo is variable throughout the world.

It never compromises contextual cognizance, but rather works towards fusing the narrative of community (past) with the needs of community (present), with the hopes of community (future). </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Amanda Iglesias, Wheaton College, Washington DC</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>Radical work is to me imbued with artistic intent. It&#8217;s pushing boundaries in a conceptual way or using uncommon techniques. Often new technology or new systems of operation are involved as methods using these tend to be less explored. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Anonymous</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>It means to fully explore ideas that are not canon with current trends.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Robert Smith Waters, Ohio State, Columbus, Ohio</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>To produce work that is never published in a flashy architecture magazine.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Anonymous</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>How do you see the value of critical opposition, collaboration, and competition from your peers in both academia and practice?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>I think our peers can sometimes be our greatest teachers.

A body of peers who think the same, work the same, and who do not compete against one another will not move forward in any worthwhile way. I also believe there needs to be a balance between that extreme and an environment of peers who cannot ever understand each other because they do not try, who do not want to work together because they cannot collaborate, and who are constantly competing with complete disregard to their peers&#8217; ideas and advice.  </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>&#8211; Meghan, University of Michigan, Michigan/Madrid</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Important and necessary, as is the case with all professions.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Justin Lai, University of Waterloo, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>All of these forces are necessary to create meaningful work.

Collaboration with both similar and radically different minds is critical- nothing can be achieved in isolation.
