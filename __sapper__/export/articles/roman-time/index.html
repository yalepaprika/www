Power-walking through the airport’s corridors gets you to the luggage claim “on time.” But lacking a specific rendez-vous time with your luggage, the sense of urgency you feel is primarily self-imposed – or is it? The same sense seems to be shared by everyone around you – the hasty movements of the passengers through the airport testify to that. The shuttle driver asks you to wait; he has to find two more passengers. The next ten minutes of waiting are agonizing. It feels like the pain comes from the act of pausing. Your pace is interrupted. You are now standing in the middle of the airport, forced to look around and observe. Passengers move in every direction, the clerks try to direct the human traffic, the shuttle drivers are on the lookout for more clients. “Ok, we are ready.” Finally the excruciating delay is over, back to moving.</span></p> <p><span>The Robert A.M.

One can read about both the Star of David that organizes Sant’Ivo’s plan and about the palimpsest of the city.
