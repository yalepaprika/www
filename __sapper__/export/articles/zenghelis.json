ARCH ‘16)<br />\nThessaloniki begs to question the lens through which architects, cities and communities plan their futures. The studio sets out to bring form, color and content to Thessaloniki’s long-time desire—a metropolitan park. The park—as well as the “ buildings in the park” paradigm—can contain a richness of program and form that can only be discovered by delving into the project. Thus, we build on the city’s concrete plans and pour in our own ideas to envision both a new city center and a new city. Away from the site, we find ourselves holding town–hall style meetings where Thessaloniki’s residents preside over us, embodied in drawings and models that exhibit their frustration when things don’t work. Constantly, we are torn between working within the limitations of the city, our self-prescribed regulations and the development of individual projects. We have been given carte blanche, but our site is spotted with fragments of the recent and distant past to which we all try to relate. Characterized by a mixture of freedoms and obligations, the project offers its tangibility in a realm of large scale urban planning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>KRISTIN NOTHWEHR (M.
