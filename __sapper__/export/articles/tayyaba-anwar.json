{"title":{"rendered":"The Ooz Manifesto"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Additionally, the Ooz provokes a response: It incites a dialogue and is a part of an ongoing riposte. It also exists temporally, in that the Ooz is the indistinct interval after the end hof an event but before its understanding, a durational gap which otherwise goes without acknowledgement, as it is typically understood to have occurred within a bounded time period. Such a condition of heterochrony within a no-man’s time zone gives the Ooz significance, as it becomes an event that refuses to be bound by a single instance. Instead, it is driven by and carried on through its repercussions, through myth and memory, extant only until one becomes fully cognizant of its existence—at which point, it slimily morphs into something else. While the physical remnants of an event have the potential to eventually fade away, the Ooz’s lingering disposition is a crucial aspect of its condition. So, would the Ooz, once deciphered, allow for an understanding about space that enables us to make strange new unexpected things? In seeing the Ooz for what it is, does everything become less oozy when seen through our distracted gaze? When does the Ooz sell out? Is there a possibility that the Ooz can be formally analyzed so that it becomes a reliable method of understanding space? Or does it only exist where order does not exist, and therefore disappears the second awareness sets in? Is it possible that the Ooz gets out of control in these types of looped inquisitions because it transforms the moment attention is applied to it? How is it so evasive and evanescent and still so ubiquitous? What kind of Borgesian condition is this, such that the longer you study it, the less you know about it? What is the Ooz, anyway?</p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Tayyaba Anwar"},"slug":"tayyaba-anwar","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch II","graduation_year":"2019"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"The Ooz"},"meta":{"volume":"4","number":"16","publication_date":"2019-04-11"}}}}
