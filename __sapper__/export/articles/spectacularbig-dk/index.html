Their twist on Hejduk’s and Loos’s projects playfully turn exhaustedly referenced projects into an aggregation of pools or a fuzzy animal alludes to mainstream trends as well. Bureau’s intentions become the antithesis of forwarding conversation in architecture: their references are literal and obvious to the trained architect, but are oblivious to the outsider. Quoted from their pool party video “…Users do not need to know our love for Cedric Price or John Hejduk”; people engaging with their architecture can refute the references completely or investigate deeper, providing opportunity for outsiders to learn about the foundations of architecture previously accessible only in academic institutions.<a href=#_ftn2 name=_ftnref2><sup>[2]</sup></a></p> <p>As a result, these one-liners in fact are extremely eye-catching; such projects are immediately legible in the split second we scroll past the press release on Instagram or ArchDaily.
