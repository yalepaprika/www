The essential Gramscian idea is hegemony. Gramsci believed that hegemony was a worldview of the whole society. The overthrow of capitalist hegemony should come by a rise of “counter-hegemonies” — alternative cultures developed by marginalized groups.

Like Kaprow, Hirschhorn’s work attempts to integrate art and life. Through works like the Gramsci Monument, the separation between life, art, artist, and audience becomes blurred. But perhaps, unlike Kaprow, there is a layer of gritty real life thrusted into the work of Hirschhorn. He affirms, “I do not want to invite or oblige viewers to become interactive with what I do; I do not want to activate the public. I want to give of myself to such a degree that viewers confronted with the work can take part and become involved, but not as actors.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>A success must be accounted for Hirschhorn’s work: an important mass of residents felt like they were participating in his work of art, rather than being invited to a work of charity.
