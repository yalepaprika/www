Our student body carries with us a wealth of perspectives from Laval to Ulaanbaatar. Â As we look at our map under a new variable to experienced time, these places become surprisingly similar. 1 week, 5 days, 24 years. This, as well as the number of cities plotted reveals an additional element that we as students bring with us to our school, a desire to develop a deeper relationship to place. Our ocean may be more vast and continents may look like islands, but we should take these waters as opportunity. Uncharted land carries with it a greater perspective adding pins to our collective map and encouraging diversity in our understanding.</span></p>\n<p>Original Google Map YSoA Visited Cities 2016 <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1nAv2GIP4blHc20H2eA3vwHXK5rA\">HERE</a></p>\n"},"meta":{"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Reorientations"},"slug":"reorientations","meta":{"volume":"2","number":"05","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2016-10-13"}}}}
