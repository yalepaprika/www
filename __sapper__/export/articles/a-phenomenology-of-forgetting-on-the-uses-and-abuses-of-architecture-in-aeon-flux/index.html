More specifically, it suggests a reading in terms of Walter Benjamin’s defense of allegory which, in its sympathetic account of the “fragmentary and enigmatic” qualities of experience, presents a potentially fruitful framework for the interpretation of this peculiar project. In Benjamin’s view, “allegory is, pre-eminently, a kind of experience,” a disorienting sense that the world, as we know it, “is not conclusion.” Beyond the Zweideutigkeit inherent in its tendency to re-present meaning through proxy, allegory operates, in part, through the expression of “sudden intuition,” the representation of some unknowable other, a transformation of the physical, or actual, into an “aggregation of signs.” [2] Not only, then, may Aeon Flux serve as an allegory of Berlin – incorporating actual buildings, spaces, and landmarks into a deeply symbolic, if wholly fictive, utopian landscape – but Aeon herself experiences this landscape allegorically; that is, through a process of fragmentary reconstruction, intuitive projection, and historical recovery.</span></p> <p><span>While Aeon appears to engage in the sort of “critical wandering”</span> <span>[3] we might associate with Benjamin’s flâneur, however, the process of historical recovery she undergoes eventually fails to bring about the change she seeks.

If we take forgetting, as such, to be “a conscious side-stepping of history in order to experience ‘the vigor of the present,’” [4] then Aeon’s final heroic act – the iconoclastic destruction of the Relical, of humanity’s only remaining link to its past – is not a reclamation, or revelation, of history; it involves no preservation or reconstruction, imaginative or otherwise.  It is, rather, a total and final erasure of that past in favor of a creative present, newly projected into the future; a monumental act of historic expression.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps, in the end, the sterile eclecticism of Bregna should be read as a warning, a critique of contemporary architecture and urbanism unmoored from tradition, without bearing in the past and, therefore, lacking the appropriate means of projecting a viable course into the future.

In re-presenting Berlin in this context – as a fragmentary assemblage of urban, architectural, and spatial vignettes – Aeon Flux insists on a much broader, more generous, ultimately pluralistic, democratic, and indeed more modern view of the city than has heretofore been allowed within debates on Berlin’s shifting urban identity since 1990.</span></p> <hr> <p> </p> <p><span>[1] Broadbent, Philip, “Phenomenology of Absence,” Journal of Modern Literature, vol. 32</span></p> <ol> <li><span> 3 (Spring 2009), p. 111</span></li> </ol> <p><span>[2] Cowan, Bainard, “Walter Benjamin’s Theory of Allegory,” New German Critique, no.22</span></p> <p><span>(Winter 1981),  p. 110</span></p> <p><span>[3] Broadbent, p. 102</span></p> <p><span>[4] Broadbent, p. 115</span></p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
