In an effort to improve “land efficiency,” the NHS is currently seeking buyers for 718 plots deemed “surplus to requirements.”³ This “commercial approach” to land disposal aims to raise £5.7 billion to help cash-strapped NHS Trusts, who have had annual budget rises restricted to one percent since 2010.⁴ Ministers have optimistically approved these selloffs in the hope that Trusts will be able to redevelop their facilities and build homes for staff.</p> <p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-6365" height=416 src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06144106/NHS_Fig1.jpg width=277></p> <p>Skeptics suggest that these land sales will primarily account for the £1.2 billion NHS deficit and £3.7 billion hospital overspending bill which has ballooned during a decade of austerity measures.⁵ Dr. Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, believes that “it is vital to safeguard the sale of NHS land from perverse short-term financial incentives… and a reduction in facilities that is insufficient to meet the future needs of patients.”⁶ The sale of the NHS’s “family silver” has attracted widespread criticism from healthcare professionals and opposing Members of Parliament who believe that hospitals will have little room to expand in the future. Under the government’s current plans, Charing Cross Hospital will shrink to just 13 percent of its current area, with its accident and emergency rooms, intensive care, and emergency services to be distributed across the city.⁷ Similar strategies will significantly diminish other flagship London care centers, including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and the historic eye<br> hospital, Moorfields.⁸</p> <p>But if the sale of the NHS Estate fails to operate in the best interests of hospital trusts, clinicians, or patients, then who stands to gain from these transactions?</p> <p>As stated in the Naylor Review, the NHS has neither an overarching strategy nor in-house technical skills to manage an estate 10 times the area of Greater London.⁹ The government’s ambition is to transfer the difficulties of owning and managing a colossal real estate portfolio to the country’s largest developers, in the hope that they will develop plots into affordable housing.

Whereas profits from the NHS Estate would traditionally fund care services, private companies are profiting from the government’s willingness to part with valuable land. One such organization rising from the ashes of public service is Project Phoenix, a public-private partnership (PPP) between NHS Trusts and regional asset management firms that organize land sales with large developers who siphon profits from the Estate away from the public purse. Once the public land is sold, NHS Trusts must then pay to rent land that it currently owns and operates: these cripplingly expensive leases<br> push already inundated Trusts further into deficit.</p> <p>Similar Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) have extended beyond land procurement and into building maintenance. St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London is now tied to a 35-year PFI contract to renovate and extend existing facilities which will cost £6.85 billion in loan interest alone.¹⁰ Ministers have insisted that PFIs ensure the risk of hospital construction and maintenance is borne by the private sector, where building delivery is also assumed to be more efficient. However, 35 percent of healthcare PFI projects have run over budget and have typically failed to insulate the public sector from hospital construction risks: the collapse of construction monolith, Carillion, forced Royal Liverpool and Birmingham Midlands Hospitals back into public administration, with the taxpayer assuming a record £7 billion liquidation bill, and leaving facilities unfinished.¹¹ The evidence abounds for the detrimental effect that PFIs and private land sales have had on the NHS’s ability to deliver suitable healthcare centers and attend to patients on time.</p> <p>The British public is ominously witnessing the structural and financial degradation of its most treasured public institution: in the process, funding for core NHS healthcare services is becoming embroiled in the fluctuations of private real estate markets and weaved into the narrative of the housing crisis unremedied by the country’s largest developers. Instead of ransacking the NHS Estate to give the private sector leverage over public services, the government should develop land it already owns and redirect profits into emerging technologies and facilities that build a resilient, twenty-first century healthcare system.
