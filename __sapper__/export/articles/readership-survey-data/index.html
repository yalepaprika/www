Adam Feldman’s and Thomas Mahon’s pieces accomplish such things.</p> <p>I thought the whole fantasy issue was amazing.</p> <p>the interview with Elisa Iturbe was very good, as was the Mark Foster Gage interview.

When was the last time the paper printed a rebuttal? When was the last it printed the words, ‘I disagree’? A high form of praise is a critique, because it means the critic believes the writer can do better.

Why did no one write up ‘Tempietto Exemplum’? Or to name a more recent example, why was there no mention or preview of ‘Garden Pleasure’? And nothing at all about Cesar Pelli – few people shaped the school, the profession, and the built environment at that level – why did his memorial last fall go uncovered, un-mentioned?</p> <p>I’d be curious to know more about the goings on of each class year…like what the hell is going on up on 6 these days?</p> <p><strong>What next?</strong></p> <p>Fictional narratives could be very enjoyable.</p> <p>Real architecture getting built</p> <p>Below-the-surface stories: what does it mean to be a student at Yale? Financially, socially? How do students feel connected or disconnected from the school’s values?</p> <p>More about what architects should do/forsake in this time of intense political and climatic turmoil</p> <p>More competing views. More intentional conflict.</p> <p>As a high school student myself, I have experienced that getting involved with architecture projects, where only graduate students and architects are, is not the easiest task and I would be interested in hearing stories from students about the time they first got introduced to architecture and how their idea about the profession has changed over the years of their studies.</p> <p>Small, local ones: who is winning the travel fellowships, and why? Who wins the Feldman, and why? Who is the school hiring, and why?</p> <p>And the biggest of them all: What is in, what is out? What is cool? What is post-modernism?</p> <p>Maybe more about people’s personal lives.</p> <p>architectural b-sides</p> <p>NYC plumbing. Why have two water mains burst in the upper west side in one month? Why does the poop smell leak from midtown west into Penn Station after everyone takes their morning dump?</p> <p>I’d like Paprika! to be more daring and honest in speaking about the curriculum and faculty.</p> <p>Old class privilege in regard to the disappearance of the middle class: how is this reflected in architecture and the built environment?</p> <p>The class segregation between designers and their users.</p> <p>Why is there still such a divide between architects who care about people, architects who care about architecture, and architects who care about money?</p> <p><strong>Buzzwords that drive you crazy?</strong></p> <p>phenomena</p> <p>Green</p> <p>Dialectic</p> <p>I’ve never understood why it’s called a curtain wall</p> <p>interstitial space</p> <p>Liminal space.</p> <p>Sou Fujimoto</p> <p>Materiality.
