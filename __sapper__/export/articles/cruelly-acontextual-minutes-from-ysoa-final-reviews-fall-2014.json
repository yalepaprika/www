Basically it’s a black square.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m worried that you’re telling yourself something that isn’t true.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Can you explain?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A lot of this is, at a certain level, just play.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Stay</b></span><b> </b>subtle. <span class=\"s3\"><b>Indulge</b></span> in these bourgeois play moves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Do you like your building?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Is that a nice thing? Is that weird?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Can you tell me when the next gondola leaves?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Is that where the gondolas go?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Let him answer.

Which, at the end of the day,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">is what we’re here for, <i>isn’t it</i>?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What is the relation between mastery of the digital medium and</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">halting, spasmodic attempts to be an <span class=\"s1\"><b>architect</b></span> in 3 dimensions?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>I guess… forms? Constrain something I’d created that could continually grow.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m having a lot of problems… Could you mumble that louder?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>The oblique, as landscape.

Peter, come on,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I’m not asking for lyricism.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lyricism would be easier.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Right to confront students with such a programmatically loaded project when all you want to talk about is form?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>Right.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cavalier, that’s the word.
