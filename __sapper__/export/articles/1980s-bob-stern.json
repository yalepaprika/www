At the end of the talk Alvin said ‘let’s go and have dinner’ and he invited her along, and I frankly didn’t know what to make of her – we were on different planets – but there was no question in my mind that she was an amazing person. I have to say I had my doubts that she would become an architect – an architect who builds – given her conversation and that subsequently the drawings I saw which were dazzlingly beautiful, the early drawings and the drawings for Peak, I don’t even think Patrik could figure out how to make those work. But that’s where I met Zaha. </span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Dima Srouji"},"slug":"dima-srouji","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2016"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Robert A.M.
