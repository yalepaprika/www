{"title":{"rendered":"Weak Hypotheses on the State of Images"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span>The problem with talking about the state of images is that there’s nothing new to say about them. We can only discuss how we see them at present.</span></p>\n<p><span>But discourse records thought, not images.</span></p>\n<p><span>Speech can be recorded through writing, but it is difficult and unpredictable to dictate an image.</span></p>\n<p><span>The ability to endlessly reproduce images displaced discourse and memory. . .</span></p>\n<p><span>. . .and images continue to reshape the spaces of our memory.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images materialize the past in the present. We experience them in and across time.</span></p>\n<p><span>Different media from different eras coexist in the same images.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images do not exist objectively.</span></p>\n<p><span>They provide space for interpretation, and our gaze continually rewrites their meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span>There can be multiple contexts behind an image, which may change over time.</span></p>\n<p><span>And meaning can now precede the image itself. Another equally unstable relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet there is perhaps now more reality in images than in reality.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are no longer rules governing image production.</span></p>\n<p><span>But everyone is good at making images.</span></p>\n<p><span>The distinction between the producer and consumer of images is fully blurred.</span></p>\n<p><span>But an image is not a photograph.</span></p>\n<p><span>The photograph was the first technical image.</span></p>\n<p><span>Technical images are a category containing the totality of all phenomena that can be created by numbers and their systematic arrangement.</span></p>\n<p><span>They go beyond reason, being made by humans and machine – not humans alone.</span></p>\n<p><span>They are meetings of material and technical knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><span>The image has always been carried by technologies of light, the essential link between us and images.</span></p>\n<p><span>No image is static. Their materiality is constantly in flux, as are the moments we encounter them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images are nothing if not mutable.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some argue that images are now social events, nodes of energy. Some say images can no longer suffer a death.</span></p>\n<p><span>The only effective way to erase an image is with other images.</span></p>\n<p><span>We live in a world that behaves like an image and reacts to their demands.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our cities are now comprised as much of text and image as they are buildings and streets.</span></p>\n<p><span>We navigate and mediate a reality composed of images by reading them, decoding them, producing them, re-producing them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images were once shaped to accommodate apparatuses, now apparatuses are shaped to accommodate images.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images pay more attention to their containers than their audience.</span></p>\n<p><span>The form of images adapt to the constraints of the platforms that ensure their continued circulation.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images cannot resist the possibilities of circulation. Continued circulation is the lifeblood of the image, sustaining their relevance.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, images rich or poor, cursed or blessed, obey the rules of ad-driven platform capital or condemn themselves to being unseen.</span></p>\n<p><span>Artists, no longer in control of images, turn to economic models to try to make sense of them.</span></p>\n<p><span>An endless trail of counter-flowing image streams form the image economy, in which there’s only one currency.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here, experiences, people, and things that can’t be turned into images are worthless.</span></p>\n<p><span>But as the scale of visibility increases, increased standardization takes hold.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images seek one another and pool themselves into exhausted semiotic fields.</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything is photographed through the same categories.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet every image, even apolitical, has the latent capacity to be weaponized, radicalized, re-contextualized and used in ways unintended by their makers.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can’t repossess these images, but you can endlessly reappropriate them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Images with different value systems increasingly exist and compete on the same significant and insignificant surfaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>Frictionless cascades of images in simulated spaces wash over our blinking reflections, unable to hold our gaze or attention.</span></p>\n<p><span>Doomed to be captioned by zoomed-in details of themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite this, over any other means, we choose to provide access to feeling through images.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s nothing left to say about images.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Vilém Flusser, </span><i><span>Towards a philosophy of photography</span></i><span>, European Photography, 1984.</span></p>\n<p><span>Marshall McLuhan, </span><i><span>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</span></i><span>, McGraw-Hill, 1964.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hito Steyerl, “In Defense of the Poor Image,” e-flux journal 10 (November 2009).</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Willis Kingery"},"slug":"willis-kingery","meta":{"degree":"M.F.A.","graduation_year":"2019"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"An Image for the Present"},"meta":{"volume":"4","number":"07","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2018-11-08"}}}}
