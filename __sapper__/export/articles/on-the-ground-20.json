Among the most creative food names: EisenMuffins, Tatlin’s Taters, and Critical Canape. Decorations included large silver balloons spelling out ‘BOB,’ and video projections on loop featuring some of our dean’s television appearances.</p>\n<p>A roast of DEAN STERN, hosted by JOHN KLEINSCHMIDT and CHARLES KANE, and included a tongue-in-cheek tutorial on how to mix martinis à la Stern (a martini glass full to the brim with vodka).</p>\n<p>In a touching story of his beginnings at YSoA,  Administrative Assistant RICHARD DEFLUMERI shared an interaction with another YSoA staff member he met at the bar Anchor. When he was introduced as  Richard, they replied, ‘you mean RICHARD?!?!,’ in reference to very enthusiastic way he’s called to attention by the Dean.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1754 alignnone\" src=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/papiXXV_OTG_pomo_richard-300x291.jpg\" alt=\"papiXXV_OTG_pomo_richard\" width=\"300\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/papiXXV_OTG_pomo_richard-300x291.jpg 300w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/papiXXV_OTG_pomo_richard-230x223.jpg 230w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/papiXXV_OTG_pomo_richard.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>He also shared his thoughts about his future at YSoA- after Dean Designate DEBORAH BERKE mentioned to him that she doesn’t yell, Richard worried, ‘How am I going to know what you want?’ Feel free to yell, Dean Berke.</p>\n<p>As things heated up during the dancing to the live band at Dean Stern’s encouragement, students continued to party, cooling off during a spontaneous systems study session, held in the seventh floor seminar room, focusing on ceiling embedded ventilation.</p>\n<p><strong>4/18:</strong> At his PhD forum, &#8220;breathing architecture,&#8221; TIM ALTENHOF traced our relationship to air from turbuculosis to gas attacks, noting that for Corbusier, the ultimate building was the lung.</p>\n<p>KYLE DUGDALE asked if ALTENHOF had come across any more compelling way of representing air than an arrow.
