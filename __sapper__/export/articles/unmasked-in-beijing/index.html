On this night, the eve of a national holiday, a skyscraper adjacent to the mall was masked in red and gold light that formed the image of the Chinese flag. I wondered: can the residents perceive the image from inside their apartments? Crossing over to the mall, I encountered another image, notable at first for no reason other than it’s overwhelming cuteness: a decidedly American family, man and woman mounted on bicycles and each pulling a young child in tow.

It critiques the general environment, whereas the umbrella critiques the police response to protest, tear gas.</p> <p>There are many things that one can observe as an American in China. Perhaps most of all, your own American-ness. My time there helped me reflect on my personal—and uniquely American—mask of individuality. By contrast, our Tsinghua peers, lacking our rugged individualism, were remarkable in terms of their ability to understand our assignment, capacity to work in groups, and general geniality.
