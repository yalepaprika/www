On the one hand, we could understand these lectures as evidence of YSoA’s liberal arts pedagogy, our pluralist embrace of different interests. On the other hand, we could view these lectures as the field of architecture reckoning with how it is employed as a means to an end: as entertainment, as an ecological and logistical apparatus, as a political tool. Although the Karma Group lecture may have felt uncomfortable, this is the reality of how architecture is used by capitalist market sectors. Rotor and Cruz+Forman argue that architecture has been instrumental in creating the problems that plague our current condition. Both practices attempt to alter problematic paradigms of our global world and economy. While in past years lectures have often felt like portfolio reviews, these lecturers understand architecture’s instrumentality within larger systems and leverage this knowledge toward their respective goals. The border between pedagogy and reality has been blurred; the school is lifting its head out of the echo chamber, and we would do well to listen.</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
