Who would call it a near-religious experience?” noted JANET MARIE SMITH, the Edward P. Bass Distinguished Visiting Architecture Fellow, ex-VP of Planning and Development of Baltimore’s adored Camden Yards, and current Sr. VP of Planning and Development for the LA Dodgers, as she began her lecture on the history of baseball stadiums, tracing their development from part of the urban fabric, to multi-purpose objects surrounded by parking (Atlanta Fulton Stadium), to single purpose stadia surrounded by parking (Kansas City Kauffmann Stadium), and back to part of the urban fabric (Camden Yards). The questions revealed many enthusiastic sports fans among the ranks. “As we know, all good ideas come out of the Midwest,” chimed Nebraskan MARK GAGE, as he pushed as to whether an urban stadium necessarily had to be nostalgic. CYNTHIA DAVIDSON – after confessing herself to be a devoted sports fan – asked if stadiums could really justify public expenditure if ticket prices were preventing them from bringing different classes together – if they were no longer operating as social condensers. KYLE DUGDALE inquired as to whether the false seduction of renderings and models, architects can ever re-establish trust, now that renders are better than ever. “Oh yeah – now with Photoshop, you drop in the client’s head and everyone goes gaga and forgets to look at what is around it,” replied JANET MARIE SMITH. </span></p> <p><span>“I just want to say, Elisa is the ideas; I am the facts,” said PETER EISENMAN before turning his lottery presentation over to ELISA ITURBE to explain lateness.</span></p> <p><span>“Schools are not places to teach, they are places to share,” noted EMRE AROLAT, Norman R.
