For the work of art, boundary has no such function; and in fact, the frame enhances the boundary, and places the work in a distance from the viewer for the aesthetic enjoyment of the viewer.</span></p>\n<p><span>A similar distinction was historically mapped by the discipline in the Pevsnerian distinction between “Architecture” and the “bicycle shed” (or the everyday built environment). The task of framing was assigned to architectural criticism and to the academic subdiscipline of history and theory. Yet, Architecture is akin to furniture (an applied art, a useful art) in Simmel’s argument. It is “something for us.” And indeed, this is the essence of architecture: Architecture is something for us. The question, then, is how to construe “us”; how to invite to the conversation groups who are not part of the preconceived “us”; how to open up space for agonism as well as dissent.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Ipek Tureli"},"slug":"ipek-tureli","meta":{"degree":" ","graduation_year":""}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Frame + Essence"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"16","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-02-23"}}}}
