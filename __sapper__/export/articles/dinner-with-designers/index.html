We had questions and frustrations as we tried to navigate the hurdles of our professional roles. We wanted to ask questions like “What is it like to teach and try to open your own office at the same time?” The dinners offer an open conversation platform to young designers at the beginning of their careers with a designer who can offer inspiration and advice. We meet new people in an intimate and memorable setting. But perhaps the most fun part is the opportunity to have a sneak peek inside another designer’s home and experience a more personal side, something we don’t often experience in professional or academic settings.”<br> – Madelynn Ringo</p> <p>Past Dinners:<br> Soirée 01 – Mark Gage, Yale Professor and Alumni.<br> Soirée 02 – Anthony Vidler, Yale Professor.<br> Soirée 03 – Jerome W Haferd and K Brandt Knapp, YSoA Alumni.<br> Soirée 04 – Adam Frampton & Karolina Czeczek – ONLY IF, Columbia +YSOA Alumni.<br> Soirée 05 – Keller Easterling, Yale Professor.<br> Soirée 06 – Wendy Evans Joseph, Harvard Alumni.<br> Soirée 07 – Sarah Oppenheimer, Yale School of Art Alumni.<br> Soirée 08 – Archie Lee Coates, Virginia Tech Alumni.<br> Soirée 09 – Martha Schwartz, Landscape Architect, Harvard Alumni.</p> <p>Upcoming Dinners:<br> Soirée 10 – Ken Smith, Harvard, November 4.<br> Soirée 11 – Tal Schori and Rustam Mehta – GRT Architects, YSoA Alumni, November 10.</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
