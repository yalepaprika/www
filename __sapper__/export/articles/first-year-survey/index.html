A professional framer aims to enrich a painting by carefully choosing its frame; in ideal circumstances, a frame will complement its most alluring features and highlight facets otherwise left unnoticed in the work. A truly successful frame will become one with the work of art it holds. (In some cases, a frame is more enticing than the painting it encloses. This is OK, too.)</p> <p>Architecture is more about catalyzing moments, events and the unfolding of human life than about capturing them. Like a framer, the architect takes care to work with precision and technical expertise whilst aiming to create an object that supports and exalts the work of art (life) it encompasses. And the analogy could continue forever more… Architecture is the construction of carefully crafted frames for life and all its complexities and simplicities. And it can frame both the beautiful and the ugly.<br> ANON.</p> <p><strong>Why did you choose to study architecture?</strong></p> <p>I first became interested in architecture during my time working at a violin shop in high school. There were images strewn around the shop of 17th century technical drawings of violins that reminded me of architectural drawings I had seen. This sparked an interest in the act and art of making of objects and space, and how that act plays out. Architecture is one of the few fields that extends into mass, weight, space, and drawing, and shapes how each of those affect people. I wanted to be a part of that.<br> DANIEL MARTY</p> <p>The first impactful encounter I had with architecture was during my college years, when I visited a madrasah, an institution of Islamic science. There I experienced a powerful and sublime unity of art and architecture – perhaps it was the imposing entrance that somehow seemed fragile with the floral motifs; or the Arabic calligraphy that celebrated pursuit of knowledge. As I further explored my interest in architecture, I became aware of its broader role in society, and decided to pursue it in a graduate school.<br> RASHID MUYDINOV</p> <p><strong>Who/what inspires you?</strong></p> <p>Steve Reich, John Coltrane, David Foster Wallace, Bob Irwin’s scrim veil, the Orinda House, Boston, Boston’s Pei, identity politics<br> WESLEY HIATT</p> <p>Falling snow, The Rite of Spring, adrenaline, Einstein, deadlines, freshly cut wood, new colors, sleep, Johnny Cash, The Adirondacks, cities.<br> ISAAC SOUTHARD</p> <p>Japanese culture, woodblock prints, traveling.<br> CECILIA HUI</p> <p>I.M.Pei, Louis Kahn and Kengo Kuma.<br> LILY HOU</p> <p>A friend of mine whom I got to know through volunteering at an old folk’s home epitomizes a lot of what I wish to become as an architect, thinker and person.
