Their partnership with local non-profit Casa Familiar has produced policy proposals and designs for new housing typologies⁷</span><span> (e.g. housing for elderly immigrants, and for communal living among families). To my knowledge, this hasn’t resulted in any built architecture yet, but as Teddy once told me, “we forget that as architects we…need to take positions…maybe the first layers towards a building might not be the building itself, but the processes that engage social, economic and political domains.”⁸</span><span> Such processes produce vital feedback loops between the extended set of participants and tap networks of knowledge typically unperceived by architecture’s conventional apparatuses. </span></p> <p><span>Halfway across the globe, in London, Karakusevic Carson Architects has recently completed public housing projects recently covered in the </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i><span>. Highlighted therein is the central role that collaboration played in their execution.⁹</span><span> The resulting architecture does not represent, perhaps, the most exciting formal investigation, nor does it successfully rebuke the prevailing conditions of the market economy. But it does strengthen the government’s and the public’s image of architects as professionals committed to a greater good. Through building, it fortifies the idea of public housing as a worthwhile collective enterprise; interpretable as a victory for a discipline that gasps in horror at the market’s socio-spatially destructive tendencies.</span></p> <p><span>For a discipline seeking consequentiality, practices like these can easily be interpreted as good news. They expand architecture’s potential set of stakeholders and put it on the path to resiliency against the market economy. Obviously, these only represent two discrete forms of practice, and there are further questions to be investigated, but their </span><i><span>modii operandi</span></i><span> exemplify something that can be learned from.</span></p> <p><span>Implicit in the work of the two exemplars I’ve highlighted is a certain willingness to allow novelty and pizzazz to yield their primacy as generators of newness and innovation. To allow sources outside of architecture to inform disciplinary questions. Christopher Hawthorne may have touched on this when he discussed “Boring architecture” in a 2017 </span><i><span>Los Angeles Times</span></i><span> article. “It is…a wrecking ball…taking down a sensibility, a kind of machismo and self-satisfaction, that desperately needed razing—one that was taking up too much space and blocking too much sunlight, that was giving other kinds of architecture very little chance to grow.”¹⁰</span><span> I venture to add, it involves abandoning irony and dissociation in favor of a project built on sincerity and earnestness, while considering positive critique as useful as negative critique. This isn’t meant to admonish formal investigation or to say that architects need to be boring or artless; but a certain </span><i><span>realpolitik¹¹</span></i><span> is at hand—our position in society is not one from which to assume a power stance. </span></p> <p><span>In 1948, just one year after Hitchcock published that polar taxonomy of practice, the office Caudill Rowlett Scott was founded in College Station, Texas. Their early work, largely centered around commissions for educational buildings, is characterized by the same techno-optimism that energized the rest of mid-century American society, with a marked adherence to mainstream stylistic Modernism. Within a few years of its founding, the office “revolutionized school design, separated ‘problem-seeking’ from problem-solving, introduced ‘programming’ into the design process, contributed to the development of construction management, spearheaded the use of computers in architecture, and produced and published influential texts on design theory and methods.”¹²</span><span> In addition to this lengthy list of inventions, the firm also introduced the written brief into architecture—a tool so routinely instrumental in almost any architectural project that it might have otherwise been thought to exist since the days of Brunelleschi. But the “genius” of the firm lay not with its founders or any particular design methodology, as Tombesi notes, “the intellectual kernel of the firm revolved around ‘process’. Under Caudill’s leadership, CRS conceived of architecture as a social-based, rationally manageable enterprise, where architects acted as clarifiers of intent and community needs…”¹³</span></p> <p><span>CRS’s process literally embedded architects within the context they were examining—among other techniques, their office posted designers as ‘squatters’ on-site, allowing the firm to viscerally grasp the problems needing solving. There is much more to be said about the manner in which the firm oriented itself towards its clients through innovative tools of public participation and communication. Sadly, in parallel with American capitalism, the office transformed over the years from a case-study in vital ‘stakeholder’ design to a chimera of shareholder corporatism—literal shareholders after their 1971 IPO.</span></p> <p><span>Along with the first two examples, CRS’s disposition as a practice loosely recalls Tigerman’s “rational-thinking architect-builder”; their methodical approach to realizing their project is informed by situational demands and adaptability of method, as well as the instrumental inclusion of different forms of understanding. In all of these cases, capital “A” architecture (which is a euphemism for architecture’s internal, immaterial discourse) is placed in dialogue with real material conditions. Tigerman’s “rationality” forms part of the basis supporting fresh criticality and speculation in these examples. It also forms the basis for a notion of </span><i><span>utopia</span></i><span>, of an optimism of consequence, grounded in the material and dispossessed of the prescriptive content present in other architectural utopias.</span></p> <p><span>In closing, it’s worth noting that the era of the “genius” and the “bureaucracy” is ongoing in many respects; but today its precepts are being increasingly questioned. In parallel, the legacies of the twentieth century continue to be challenged, and the world continues its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. The world continues to grow; but will the future need architects?</span></p> <p><span>At the dawn of the postmodern era, in 1967, Vincent Scully published “America’s Architectural Nightmare,” an essay admonishing the destructive, scarring consequences that Modernist architecture’s utopian, car-driven vision visited on New Haven. Scully’s work as an architectural historian, along with the work of other authors like Jane Jacobs, helped introduce the city, architectural history, and skepticism toward positivist “progress” as viable public discussions in that era—developments almost taken for granted today.

Under Caudill’s leadership, CRS conceived of architecture as a social-based, rationally manageable enterprise, where architects acted as clarifiers of intent and community needs…”¹³\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ECRS’s process literally embedded architects within the context they were examining—among other techniques, their office posted designers as ‘squatters’ on-site, allowing the firm to viscerally grasp the problems needing solving. There is much more to be said about the manner in which the firm oriented itself towards its clients through innovative tools of public participation and communication. Sadly, in parallel with American capitalism, the office transformed over the years from a case-study in vital ‘stakeholder’ design to a chimera of shareholder corporatism—literal shareholders after their 1971 IPO.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAlong with the first two examples, CRS’s disposition as a practice loosely recalls Tigerman’s “rational-thinking architect-builder”; their methodical approach to realizing their project is informed by situational demands and adaptability of method, as well as the instrumental inclusion of different forms of understanding. In all of these cases, capital “A” architecture (which is a euphemism for architecture’s internal, immaterial discourse) is placed in dialogue with real material conditions. Tigerman’s “rationality” forms part of the basis supporting fresh criticality and speculation in these examples. It also forms the basis for a notion of \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eutopia\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E, of an optimism of consequence, grounded in the material and dispossessed of the prescriptive content present in other architectural utopias.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIn closing, it’s worth noting that the era of the “genius” and the “bureaucracy” is ongoing in many respects; but today its precepts are being increasingly questioned. In parallel, the legacies of the twentieth century continue to be challenged, and the world continues its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. The world continues to grow; but will the future need architects?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAt the dawn of the postmodern era, in 1967, Vincent Scully published “America’s Architectural Nightmare,” an essay admonishing the destructive, scarring consequences that Modernist architecture’s utopian, car-driven vision visited on New Haven. Scully’s work as an architectural historian, along with the work of other authors like Jane Jacobs, helped introduce the city, architectural history, and skepticism toward positivist “progress” as viable public discussions in that era—developments almost taken for granted today.
