And engaging with color in my own work reminds me that the desire to simply be delighted is more fruitful than the desire to be “great or nothing.” Restoring this deep trust in my body and what she perceives allows me to make a creative commitment confidently, not from a place of certainty, but from the humble recognition that within an infinite spectrum there is no “correct choice,” only the one that happens to delight me.</p> <p>Color is a choice in every project, even if that choice is white or grey.

White assumes the role of the most logical and considered choice, but its prevalence across all programs and scales reveals how unexamined it really is within the discourse and practice.

After much discussion, we were allowed to use the color of our choice, only if we agreed to never refer to it as “Pink,” but used the less politicized “Cherry” instead.

Architects take issue with delivering this colorful world because modernism taught us that our bodies were better nurtured by rational environments than delightful ones.

Architects have a reputation for being exacting. At their worst, they can be stubborn and pretentious, at their best, they protect important interests that budget, schedule, and code do not. Mediums of delight such as color, easily become afterthoughts if architects are not committed to their manifestation. Delight deserves to be taken seriously in architecture, both for the sake of the architect and of those who experience their work. Architecture is capable of distributing free sensual delights to the public. And that delight must start within us. Engaging our own delight as a part of the design process not only leads to better work, but healthier and happier designers. When we commit to delight, we commit to humanity within our buildings and our practices. Color adds what is often referred to as “personality,” reflecting our humanity by simply existing as a very specific combination of hue and shade amid a near-infinite number of possibilities. This infinite spectrum can overwhelm our rationality, cultivating indecision, and undermining trust in ourselves. In that state, we default to non-choices which affirm the status quo, dressing buildings in white forever. But if we commit to bathe ourselves in color, through sensations and environments that delight us, we are more able to share that delight in our architecture.</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
