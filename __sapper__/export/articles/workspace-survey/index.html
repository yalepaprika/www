In early December, a 2-week survey polled 80 YSOA students to gather opinions suggestions about working in Rudolph Hall.</p> <p class=p1>The first question asked if the students think studio desks should be grouped based on the critic. A 70% majority answered “yes”: group desks enhance collaboration and foster a sense of studio identity. Sitting within a condensed proximity allows for easier communication and shared feedback among the students. It can be helpful to “hear your critic’s comments about others’ work during desk crits.”</p> <p class=p1>Another student noted that sitting together makes practical sense for advanced studios who each share a site model, but not so much for first- and second-year studios. “The site is the same for the entire class. I feel the first and second-years would benefit from indirectly incorporating various methodologies discussed by critics other than yours.” Other students agreed, citing the potential for a mixed-up studio arrangement to encourage “interaction across each studio’s work” and reduce the “artificial subgroups” of desks arranged by studio critic.

We can’t deny that there is plenty of space to work in Rudolph Hall. One student even called Rudolph Hall “the most productive architecture school building.” But is it the right type of workspace?
