Commenting on the arc of his interdisciplinary work, Riano said, “I teach people to use design as an activist tool.” As such, he asserted, “To do political design work is to understand yourself as a precarious worker.” With this, Riano concluded his presentation with a discussion of labor, appealing to the advocacy of The Architecture Lobby.

Organized by PhD candidate KYLE DUGDALE, advertised around the school with flyers that read &#8220;Boom,&#8221; and sponsored by Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography and the PhD Dialogue Series, the &#8220;Architecture of the Book&#8221; workshop invited students to discuss books as design objects and storehouses of information. Among Boom&#8217;s many reflections on the importance of books, she agrees with Koolhaas that &#8220;a book is a container that tells a story about a building.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E“If I told Richard it was a diptych, he would say it is a diptych” PETER EISENMAN told his seminar after recounting that a fellow member of his New York quintych insisted he had never designed such a thing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E“He did it in 10 seconds, it took us years to get there,” said guest lecturer KEVIN SCHORN of his boss Renzo Piano, as he walked the second year Systems Integration class through the 16,000-odd shop drawings for the new Whitney Museum.
