Not the kind of stuck where you find yourself back in school simply because you don’t know what else to do, but the kind where you actually have an obligation to be there.

Traversing the taupe and paprika spaces felt like panning through the movie set of Synecdoche, New York; something didn’t feel quite right. Since there were so few people in the building, one felt impelled to say hello to any passerby – even those you would never greet during the school year.

The Retrospecta editors burst into cheers and snapped their fingers in the air every time they completed a portion of their book. Architecture Foundations students tore their hair out over the idea of hand-drawing axonometric staircases. Our heroic janitors vanished the piles of garbage, leftover materials, superglued desks, and abandoned model bases.

For another academic year, we will claim this building as our own: our work space, our home, our jail, and our bubble away from the real world. We will become a seemingly integral part of Rudolph Hall and fill it with our experiences and creations, only for them to be erased again next summer. The building will continue to live on without us, for we are merely temporary inhabitants in this concrete shell. In a year or two, other ambitious academics will take our desks and our favorite seats in Hastings Hall, and all of the things we accomplished here will become nothing but traces of our own memories.
