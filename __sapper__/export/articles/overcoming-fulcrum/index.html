I am not sure if we knew of Fulcrum when we started Paprika!, but we should have. Also run by students, also a single sheet weekly, Fulcrum was much of what Paprika! aspired to be. It could pair the writing of students with some of the most accomplished voices in the field; it could speak with urgency and authority about its community and its politics; and it had a wide following beyond the school. Its last issue claimed that it was the most-read student architecture publication in the world.</p> <p>On June 27, 2014, a mere eight days before Paprika! announced itself and made its first call for submissions, Jack Self, Fulcrum’s co-founder and editor, published its 100th issue and pulled the plug.<br> “Our reasoning is neither jealousy nor some arrogant fear of plagiarism,” its last editorial said, “but simply the fact that what follows Fulcrum must be propositional, of its time, and wholly original.”<br> Now that we have arrived at Paprika x100, is it time to follow suit?

The publication is to remain financially and organizationally independent of the school. The Coordinating Editors and Publisher must approve all expenditures. Meetings and calls for submissions are to be open. Everyone who has made a substantial contribution to the publication shall become part of the Collective. The On-Campus Collective, the students, can impeach the Coordinating Editors. Most importantly, the On-Campus Collective can amend the Baton.</p> <p>We co-founders gave up all control of Paprika! before we graduated, when, in December of 2015, Maggie Tsang and Tess McNamara were elected the Coordinating Editors, and Caroline Acheatel their Publisher. In choosing to embrace those roles, take up the rules of the Baton, and assemble a team of writers, editors, and designers, they effectively re-founded Paprika!, because rules have only as much power as the living give them.

Rather than ask who wrote them, or whether they are original, I would pose simply: do they work? Are they useful?

It puts their work in front of a readership far beyond the walls of its school. It secures perspectives and answers from some of architecture’s most promising practitioners. It has provided a firm platform to advocate reforms as small as the establishment of a lunch hour (check), and as large as the establishment of a department of Urban Design (not yet). It provides a forum to propose and challenge ideas. Through the Collective, it offers the support and perspective of a network whose members now number 185. Most importantly, Paprika! tells a story—about school, about ideals, about the potentials and pitfalls of architecture—and by telling the story, shapes the story, and changes the story.</p> <p>In that last issue of Fulcrum, the editorial made a compelling exhortation: “Use the long-term as a subversive strategy. Develop ten-year plans. Develop fifty-year plans. Learn to transform and trade in the possibility of tomorrow today, just like the financial elite to whom we are beholden.” Paprika! got here by executing a five-year plan. What will it accomplish over the next hundred?</p> <p>Is Paprika! “wholly original”? No. We did not invent the newspaper, democracy, by-laws, or InDesign.</p> <p>Does it work? Is it useful?
