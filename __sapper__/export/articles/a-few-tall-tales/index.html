Standing before a painting, we enter into the world of the image, exchanging our physical presence for virtual immersion. As Boris Groys points out in his essay “Art on the Internet,” the goal of the avant-garde in the 20th century was to render art nonfictional. To unite art and life is to make art factual, literal, or conceptual rather than virtual or immersive. This modern ambition has become our contemporary circumstance. Now, artists who share their work on social media and/or see their work proliferate online through its image encounter a more universal and potent form of nonfictionalization.
