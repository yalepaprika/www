We see you a lot!</span></p> <p><span>GA: I see people graduating; you get used to seeing them from when they first come in with their freshmen face, all full of wonder, all fresh. But then in the middle of the semester, they become all tired! I just want to hug you all. First year is a hard year. I think the most difficult part is the final reviews. The library is full; there is a lot going on. I have to say, I am proud to work for Yale, period. It’s a wonderful industry to work for. Seeing you every year is a wonderful feeling, I feel proud of you guys. I do cry when you leave! This happens especially when I get close to students, the ones we know by name, they share and I share my personal things, so when I see them gone—for example today, one of the Art History majors here was saying goodbye because she’s moving to Boston—I say “Don’t go, please!” You get used to it, but it’s not easy.</span></p> <p><span>P!: Do you have a favorite place in this building? You make your rounds everyday, but you also sit here in the lobby, so is there a favorite place of yours?</span></p> <p><span>GA: It’s the seventh floor balcony, facing York Street, because you can see most of the University. Especially right now when the leaves are changing color, and then winter when the snow comes. Yes, that would be my favorite spot.</span></p> <p><span>P!: That’s probably our favorite spot too. Is there any part of the building that makes it unpleasant?</span></p> <p><span>GA: I don’t think so. Of course, for safety reasons, I make sure all the doors are clear. The back of the sub-basement—I’ve never seen anyone there. Other than that, no. Every building has its own character. Sometimes I work in other areas of the University. For the most part I know every building in this entire University. I know the people but I also get to know the building.</span></p> <p><span>P!: What do you feel about this building compared to other buildings on campus?</span></p> <p><span>GA: This is my building!</span></p> <p><span>P!: What do you wish this building had, if it needed anything?</span></p> <p><span>GA: I don’t know, like I said, every building has its own character.</span></p> <p><span>P!: We’re interested in how you said every building has its own character. For example, the colleges here have a different aesthetic than Rudolph Hall. What does that difference mean to you?</span></p> <p><span>GA: For example, in the Medical building, there are a lot of labs. [In] the Anatomy building, on the third floor, there are bodies. When I used to work in that area, I loved it. It has a special identity to it, you know? I look forward everyday to come here. You guys make my day. I see all the projects, from the beginning to the end. And then I get to see them in the gallery.
