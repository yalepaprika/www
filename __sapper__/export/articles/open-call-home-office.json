{"title":{"rendered":"Open Call: HOME OFFICE"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dear fellow students,</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We have come upon an unprecedented situation that is altering the way we study, work and live. In the name of continued collaboration we are announcing an open call for contributions to a collaborative project titled <i>HOME OFFICE</i>. The project will explore the diverse approaches, ingenuous inventions and hyper specific measures taken to make our new temporary workplaces. As a collection of plan drawings the project will trace similarities and differences in our organization of space while rendering the collective image of a transient organizational typology specific to the online semester of Spring 2020.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">→</span><span class=\"s1\"> THE HOME OFFICE PLAN<br />\nWe are asking for a plan drawing of your workplace in your home (only the room in which you are primarily working from). Choice of drawing style is completely free but should stay within general conventions of the architectural plan drawing and have an indication of scale for reference (1/2” or 1/4” scale will probably work for most drawings). The drawing can be as elaborate as you wish, and should fit within a 12”×12” box when printed to scale.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">→</span><span class=\"s1\"> SUBMISSION<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\">Send us your plan drawing as a PDF file by email to gustav.nielsen@yale.edu or upload it to a folder called <i>HOME OFFICE PROJECT</i> on the temporary drive on the school server by Friday, May 8<sup>th</sup>, at 5:00 p.m. Your file name should include your name as well as the city and country in which your home office is located. For any questions please write to<br />\ngustav.nielsen@yale.edu.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We hope that you will take part in this collaborative project which we believe will be a joyful way to reflect upon the situation and stay together despite being apart! Stay safe and sane!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">—Rachael, Jack, Diana and Gustav</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-7701\" src=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"840\" srcset=\"https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/19221352/Home-Office_Gustav-Nielsen-and-Diana-Smiljkovic_New-Haven_USA-1200x1200.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span class=\"s2\">→ → </span>Home Office, Diana Smiljkovic (M.Arch I &#8217;22) and Gustav Nielsen (M.Arch I &#8217;22), New Haven, USA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Rachael Tsai"},"slug":"rachael-tsai","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2022"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Gustav Nielsen"},"slug":"gustav-nielsen","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2022"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Diana Smiljkovic"},"slug":"diana-smiljkovic","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2022"}},{"title":{"rendered":"Jack Rusk"},"slug":"jack-rusk","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I ","graduation_year":"2022"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"State of the Carpet Bulletin"},"slug":"state-of-the-carpet-bulletin-2020","meta":{"volume":"5","number":"06","bulletin":true,"publication_date":"2020-03-20"}}}}
