Using architecture from different climatic regions, we positioned indigenous structures as forms of nonverbal storytelling, just as capable of expressing cultural tradition and environmental information as the familiar verbal/written stories. The following weeks focused on development of team proposals for a small pavilion sited in the school’s Pear Tree Yard (a space for outdoor education, events, and play).
