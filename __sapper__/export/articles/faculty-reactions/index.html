It doesn’t take much to muddy the waters, and muddy waters can stay muddy for a long time.</p> <p>Mark Foster Gage<br> As a gay kid from Nebraska, from a hard-core military family, who then went to The University of Notre Dame where, at the time, gay groups weren’t even allowed to meet on campus. It’s fantastic that YSoA is having a discussion about what constitutes a safe, inclusive, educational environment. The AAU sexual climate survey meeting we had in Hastings was, as I understand it, intended primarily to deliver the information on the various surveys—I think the real conversation will be unfolding over the next few days, weeks, and years. So my initial reaction is of course sexual harassment in all forms must end. Full stop. But as for the safe climate aspect of the equation there seem to be two poles, one where students are shrouded in bubble wrap and protected from everything—even ideas they potentially should be exposed to, and the other where all speech is permissible in the name of a challenging education. The ongoing conversation our school will be having will be about where on that spectrum we should be. It is an immensely delicate task as our students and faculty come from over 66 countries, and from at least five generations. How do we collectively celebrate this immense diversity of backgrounds while finding a common safe datum from which to teach and learn? I look forward to being part of these discussions.</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
