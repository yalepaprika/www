{"title":{"rendered":"Summer Survey Results"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Summer at Yale is as diverse in it’s range of activities as the academic year itself. M.Arch I students start the season with the construction phase of the Building Project and the final Visualization class (the intent, methodology, and reason for existence, of which remains questioned by some students). Some second year students take on the tradition of the architectural ‘Grand Tour’ and spend a month in Rome, sketching details of antiquities and contemporary structures. Still others take advantage of the time to repose and replenish before the fall semester, while for some, the summer is chock full of<br />\ndeadlines, research projects, and internship assignments. And then there are the ‘chosen ones,’ those selected among the incoming students to attend the summer bootcamp even before taking their first true fall semester course at<br />\nthe School.</p>\n<p>With this breadth in mind, we asked you to share your summer experiences with the YSOA community. Presented here are the compiled photographs and writings of the paths taken and the roads travelled, both near and far, in the<br />\nbrief sojourn from our collective journey, one which recommences today in Rudolph Hall.</p>\n<p><b>Where were you this summer?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Rome and San Francisco</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>UK, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Greenwich, Connecticut; Kentucky, and Puerto Rico</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Europe and China</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Berkeley, CA and  Rushford Lake, NY</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Chile</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What were you doing there?</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>“In Orient, New York,  I&#8217;ve been working on events related to the Architecture Lobby and also working on my research on how the Sherman Antitrust Act affects architecture and the workings of the AIA.  Idaho was backpacking in the White Cloud range with my son, Cam, and daughter, Frances.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span>-Peggy Deamer</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>I went to Rome for the Yale program: Continuity and Change, and I did an internship. </span></p>\n<p><i><span>-Jessica Elliott</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>In Greenwich, I worked for the fabulous architects of Joeb Moore &amp; Partners.

This structure was said to have been built by an East Coast barn builder. I spent the remainder of the summer hiking/kayaking/etc. in upstate New York, and found many dilapidated barns very similar to the one I worked on in CA.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Timon Covelli</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>BP internship. Built a house. Got sweaty. Learned not only what it takes to construct a wood frame building and master my chop saw skills, but also the challenges of construction management.

I flew direct from Rome to Charlotte, North Carolina, and retreated to the Smoky Mountains to recover from the shock. When I ran out of food, I left the forest and built a chicken coop on a farm. Once the chickens moved in, I went to New Orleans where the questionable future of the Connecticut coastline was dropped in my lap: I prepared maps and diagrams to support the State of Connecticut&#8217;s application for a slice of the $1 billion HUD is offering for resiliency projects.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-John Kleinschmidt</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>I did a ten day workshop with fourteen  participants, where we learned how to mix cob (clay/straw/sand) to build earthen walls, construct solid foundation systems and make adobe bricks. We also learned light-straw-clay infill technique for conventional stud or timber framed buildings, earthen plasters, and earthen floors. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>-Caitlin Baiada</span></i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><span>I have been traveling to Europe and China with friends and it was an amazing experience.
