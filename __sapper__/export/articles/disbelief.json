I cannot measure the <span class=\"s1\">perfectly proportioned elements </span><span class=\"s3\">ahead of time and combine them in </span><span class=\"s1\">an elegant rhythm. I have to figure it out as I go, make decisions with, perhaps, not enough careful consideration, and address the </span><span class=\"s3\">consequences later. Turmeric will </span><span class=\"s1\">probably go with this? We’ll see. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Several times I’ve made the mistake of setting out on a design problem in a 100% pragmatic state of mind. In these instances, I was prepared to carefully consider the needs of every contextual element and stakeholder simultaneously. </span><span class=\"s3\">But this mindset makes me cau</span><span class=\"s1\">tious and uncreative. It prevents me from doing, and makes my objects too precious to ever be worth anything. Jurors aren’t upset with these projects, but they don’t find them interesting either. All of my best projects (at least to me, and </span><span class=\"s3\">right now I’m the only one who has </span><span class=\"s1\">to eat my own cooking, besides </span><span class=\"s4\">Andrew) start with some suspension</span><span class=\"s1\"> of disbelief—allowing myself to do something strange, ridiculous, or confrontational, and then figuring it out from there. My studio critic </span><span class=\"s3\">and I briefly ignore the fact that my </span><span class=\"s2\">first design intuition will never </span><span class=\"s4\">be built, that it’s entangled with ele</span><span class=\"s2\">ments that architects have no<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\">con</span><span class=\"s2\">trol over, or that it makes its </span><span class=\"s1\">occupants’ lives more difficult to prove a point.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">Each semester inevitably reach</span>es the point where I have to reckon <span class=\"s4\">with</span> my suspended disbelief and <span class=\"s3\">make the project actually work (or, </span>at least, a studio level of working). <span class=\"s2\">At this point, things get worse—much worse. But at the moment </span><span class=\"s1\">when an unresolved idea collides </span><span class=\"s3\">with a poorly placed fire stair in an </span><span class=\"s3\">illogical pile that I can hardly stand </span>to look at any longer, I know that <span class=\"s2\">things are about to get better. </span>My projects always follow the same pattern: a promising idea blossoms, <span class=\"s2\">crashes and burns, and then is </span>slowly resolved from the mess. Every decent project of mine tends <span class=\"s4\">to get worse before it gets better. If </span>it never gets worse, the idea wasn’t worth struggling with in the first place. I cook because baking doesn’t get worse before it gets better; it <span class=\"s2\">requires precision from the start. </span>Once it’s in the oven, you can only <span class=\"s3\">cross your fingers. In cooking, you build flavor, taste and correct. Even </span>if you add too much salt, you can always add more of everything else.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I wonder about the consequences <span class=\"s1\">of my process in the real world. When actual lives stand to be affec</span><span class=\"s2\">ted by your work, you should be </span><span class=\"s5\">pragmatic and sensitive to their </span><span class=\"s1\">needs. You should think before you do. I don’t know what to make of the fact that my most sensitive project is a vanilla cake snooze fest. One of the guest critics on this particular vanilla cake review told me he could see my project being </span><span class=\"s3\">built, and he meant that as an in</span><span class=\"s4\">sult. </span><span class=\"s3\">Maybe I’ll get better at baking, </span><span class=\"s1\">but in my seven years of architec</span><span class=\"s2\">ture school, I’ve learned that </span><span class=\"s3\">my design process is <i>Chopped</i>, not </span><span class=\"s1\"><i>The Great British Baking Show</i>. </span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Katie Lau"},"slug":"katie-lau","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2020"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"A Dash of ______"},"slug":"a-dash-of-______","meta":{"volume":"5","number":"19","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2020-04-23"}}}}
