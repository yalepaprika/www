At a Fall 2014 midterm review, one student’s project was singled out for lying far outside the well-trodden path of academic discourse. More than dynamic form, sinuous facades or an interplay of masses in light, it undermined established norms of scholarly conversation in the grand effort of teaching architecture. A seemingly brash collage of Pompeii, Mies’s Crown Hall and the student’s own hand, a critic feared that this student did not “get it”. </span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>“Mies invented the open plan.”</span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>“Are you kidding me?

But so was the audience. What a powerful project it was, to be able to cast doubt in the minds of all who were present.</span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>The Pompeii-Mies project’s currency lies in its ability to demand introspection among all who viewed it; not because it was actually innovative or novel: the other projects were simply too inhibited, too guarded by misplaced good intentions to generate architectural discourse. Pompeii-Mies critiqued the very nature of the architecture project here at Yale. How tragic it would be for a student to look back upon countless building designs and feeling like he/she has accomplished nothing. Everything has been produced in vain. Everything was done at the whims of critics, established systems and normative methods of architectural production, and the student finds that he/she is just another product of a machine. </span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>A good architecture school is a laboratory of free experimentation, not merely a proving ground for professional practice — let lesser schools do that. Experimentation brings with it the responsibility of novelty. As students of creative design, we are charged with the creation of the ‘new’. Yet, the notion of ‘new’ is the subject of unending debate. What is the basis of architectural novelty? In a world of endless images, iterations, and déjà vu, this is a perplexing question, but I have impressions of an answer. </span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>Something is termed ‘new’ when it is perceived to meet certain criteria. Often, this is the ‘never-before-seen’, but this is often subject to an individual’s prior exposure. </span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>Hence, let’s attempt to concretize principles of the ‘new’. These come to mind: Repudiation of the status quo. Cycles of re-interpretation. Tokyo versus Rome. Returning to humanity. Misreadings of the past, of the Masters. Of equating Mies to Walmart and being mocked for it. The truly new will most certainly be uncomfortable, even repulsive. It will be rarely welcomed, because it has no comparable precedent.</span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>When faced with a barrage of plans, drawings, renderings, and graphics, I keep searching for a basis on which the pedagogical machine can be measured against. Surely, such a measure must exist, for without which there would be no teaching of architecture. Surely, such a measure cannot be limited to a table as dry as the NAAB Conditions for Accreditation. Some might argue that it is foolhardy to even imagine a common scale could apply to architecture today, with its infinite permutations and limitless scope, but without such a scale we are left groping about in the dark, debating nothing.</span></p> <p class=p1><span class=s1>This pyramid is a method of sorts.
