Objects/ideas/beings that may be seemingly disparate can be understood through some shared frame, with scales varying from the interpersonal to the societal to the universal.

Just as cleanliness is a highly charged politic – originating in European colonial projects, physically embodied in the white walls and the rectilinearity of hospitals, overseer’s houses, colonial government buildings, etc. – that defines indigenous bodies and identities as unclean, equally charged are all binarist constructions. East-West, female-male, black-white, ancient-modern, dirty-clean, teacher-student, bad-good, developing-developed are all highly charged relationships.

Not only do we not acknowledge the histories of these languages, we employ and re-employ them.
