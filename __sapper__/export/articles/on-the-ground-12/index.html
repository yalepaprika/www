Later, students enjoyed a concert at Carnegie Hall featuring the Orchestre National de France. The next day, a group went to see the Yale Philharmonia perform at Woolsey Hall.

Cecilia snagged the Takenaka Internship in Osaka, Japan, and will study flexible spatial organization through the concept of Hashi by surveying sacred, residential, and public spaces in rural and urban Japan.</p> <p>1/29: It was like seeing three thousand Kehinde Wiley paintings at once. A small group of architecture students wandered outside of the normal boundaries of Rudolph Hall to see The Yale School of Drama’s amazing production of ‘Women Beware Women’. YANA BIRYUKOVA’s projection design tore us from our seats and deposited us in the middle of a delicious tangled mashup of Medici Florence and Tarantino’s Los Angeles.</p> <p>1/30: Saturday’s screening of ‘Sunset Boulevard’ drew a modest but enthusiastic audience of first and second years. The 1950’s camp classic follows its aging protagonist’s descent into irrelevance and lunacy, a familiar scenario in Hastings Hall.</p> <p>2/1: CARTER WISEMAN’S course Writing on Architecture welcomed guest speaker Philip Kennicott, the Art and Architecture Critic for the Washington Post. Mr. Kennicott pointed out that woeful economic conditions have made it difficult for newspapers to maintain dedicated architecture critics with powerful, expressive voices like Ada Louise Huxtable.</p> <p>2/1: At the Coastal Resilience and Urban Water Systems Symposium, LAUREN ELACHI, a landscape architect at SCAPE, expanded job descriptions: ‘The designer can reinvent the structure of societal response to risk.’ DANIEL PITTMAN of OMA dodged questions about the shortcomings of Rebuild By Design.
