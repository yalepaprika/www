This change in tone, from the pre-WWII outdoor culture of woodcraft, hunting, and living off the land (itself a response to the threat of the automobile to America’s wilderness) marked a recognition of overuse at multiple scales, from human to mechanical and from individual to collective. However, the principles established by the new program address impact and use on an immediate and localized scale, effectively erasing the perception of the present as an historical product.

This park-side city would be one of localized centers of residue formed by accumulations of caravans, tents, telescoping titanium, 300-fill down jackets, air padded sleeping pads, nylon, polyester, and Gore-Tex. Tendrils of impact would snake out into ‘pristine’ areas formed by organic paths of residue spreading out from high-use areas. But this city need not be a protrusion on the landscape.

The sanctity of the landscape could be preserved, if from a distance, with the inverted city only visible at its borders.</p> <p>These are possibilities only because Leave No Trace does not consider the role of aggregation on impact. There is a distance between use and impact, passively enforced by the language used, which distorts the cause and effect relationship between them. By imagining the ability to spread impact, they allow us to think of an impact camouflage, a moderation of sensation by a matching of intensities, resulting in the creation of a new collective environment that undermines the explicitly singular aspect of their message: the agency of an individual to make a difference. This intent is not strange, nor should it be. For decades, American literature has foregrounded the spiritual significance of an individual’s engagement with the natural world.

Here again we could imagine residue emerging, snaking between structures and creating new connections, as the impact of a struggle of use.</p> <p> </p> <figure class="alignnone wp-caption" id=attachment_1174><a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2.jpeg><img height=650 src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2.jpeg width=970 alt="A drawing from a government handbook" class="size-full wp-image-1174" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2.jpeg 970w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2-830x556.jpeg 830w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2-230x154.jpeg 230w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cartelli_Residue_Image_Option2-350x235.jpeg 350w"></a><figcaption class=wp-caption-text>A drawing from a government handbook</figcaption></figure> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
