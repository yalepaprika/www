Sylvia was teaching theory and history at the Angewandte while I was at the ETH in Zurich as the Professor of Spatial Conception and Exploration introducing robotics into their curriculum. So many people that teach or visit Angewandte diploma reviews are impressed by the depth and quality of the graduating students and attribute this to the depth model of studio education there. You would find at UCLA, Yale, Ohio State University and SCIArc, many of the Angewandte faculty as well as Angewandte graduates, and at these places there is some attempt at extending past the semester or quarter schedule to allow for more mentoring over time rather than quick experiences imitating a master.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPortraits by Abraham Lampert (MFA &#8217;17)\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},meta:{contributors:[{title:{rendered:"Wolf D.
