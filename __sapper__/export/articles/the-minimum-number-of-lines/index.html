They constitute a framework of written and unwritten rules. Often it takes those from disciplines outside of architecture to unmask the apparently innocent architectural line. </span></p> <p><span>An example is the artist Dan Graham, whose unrealised 1978 project </span><i><span>Alteration to a Suburban House</span></i><span> proposes, firstly, the removal of the front wall of a typical American tract house and its replacement by a wall of plate glass, and secondly, the erection of a mirrored wall running parallel to the newly glazed front wall along the longitudinal axis of the house.

But even these most minimal of lines are highly charged, for the glass wall dissolves</span><span>—</span><span>visually at leas</span><span>t—</span><span>the boundary. The main living spaces of the house become visible from the public realm and the public realm in turn invades the living room via the view through the glass wall and its doubling in the reflective dividing wall. Because a viewer in the street can now see directly into the house, a major spatial and political characteristic of suburbia</span><span>—</span><span>the strict division of space into public and private realms</span><span>—</span><span>is undermined. However, the new boundaries still resonate with the alternating current of the public/private relationship, because the viewer looking in from the outside is visible not only to those inside, but also to herself, reflected in the mirror beyond the glass. She is therefore unveiled, to those who she can see and to herself, as the voyeur. Thus, just as the frontier between public and private realms is weakened in its physical materiality, it is reinforced psychologically in the mind of the viewer/voyeur.</span></p> <p><span>A few years back, in response to a project brief requesting some studies of simple geometries, a student at the University of Westminster, taped out two adjacent squares onto a London sidewalk.
