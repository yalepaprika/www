I thought this was the fanciest pen I could ever own, with its streamlined steel nib and unique paperclip style cap.<br> Enter 2014: one boring afternoon in studio while browsing the internet. I discovered one of the biggest time sinks and<br> wallet destroyers to enter my starving-student life. There are other pens than the Lamy that both look cool and are more<br> sophisticated than a Sakura Micron? You bet. Pens have<br> variety in the most minute ways: barrel shapes, lengths, intricate finial and clip details, weight, nib thicknesses, twist<br> or snap caps, converter or piston filling. Pens are also made<br> of what feels like a library of all the materials you could<br> make your studio models out of. There is no shortage of variation to this obsession, and while I have a little less weight in my bank account, it is worth it.<br> I believe nothing is mightier to the designer than the pen, so why not overcomplicate and explore all the ways we can put pen to paper.
