One devastatingly impactful component of contemporary urban infrastructure in New Delhi, for instance, is the Ring Road – an enormous beltway encircling the city. While on the surface the Ring Road appears to be little more than an especially efficient automotive transportation network, this non-stop infrastructural switch allows traffic to pass, unimpeded, through vast stretches of some of New Dehli’s most impoverished neighborhoods, without so much as a traffic light, without having to stop, without ever being seen. K.T. Ravindaran, former head of the New Delhi School of Planning and Architecture, has noted that “One of the most common places of rape in Delhi is a moving vehicle…They can just go on until the fuel runs out.” The construction of bridges and overpasses along major roadways has gradually eliminated the need for traffic lights, steadily increasing the speed of urban vehicular traffic over the last decade.
