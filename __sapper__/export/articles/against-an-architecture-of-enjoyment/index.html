Purpose-built, it was one of the earliest modern discotheques on the Mediterranean coast, and “the best of its kind in Europe,” said Georgie Fame. Four years later, on August 24th, 1969, Francesc Tubáu Subirat, aged 18, drove a motorbike without a license to the entertainment venue’s doors. He placed eight dynamite cartridges and a detonator on the roof of the club with the intention of blowing it up.1 It was Monday at 2 am and around 800 people gathered on the dance floor. The explosion could have killed many of them, yet Tubáu was startled by a waiter before having a chance to detonate. Fleeing away, he fell unconscious on the street and was arrested. A summary court martial condemned him for terrorism to 18 years<br> of reclusion.</p> <figure class="aligncenter wp-caption" id=attachment_6874><img height=243 src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11230710/IMG-1-1.jpg width=471 alt="" class=wp-image-6874 sizes="(max-width: 471px) 85vw, 471px" srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11230710/IMG-1-1.jpg 640w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11230710/IMG-1-1-300x154.jpg 300w"><figcaption class=wp-caption-text>Exterior view of Tiffany’s in late 1960’s.

In 1969, Platja d’Aro was a village of less than 2,500 inhabitants,5 yet there were at least six night clubs with capacity for more than 5,000 people.6 These discotheques, and many others that spread along the coast, were a constituent part of the tourist ecosystem, which included many other pleasure-related infrastructures, like aqua-parks and chiringuitos,7 catering and hospitality services.

Taken with anarchist and socialist theories, he wrote a plan of action in June of 1969 that included “direct action in all its forms: from individual bombs to the armed guerrilla group.”9 The text sounded more like a political declaration than a realistic plan for execution, yet the solitary attack was perpetrated. The bomb in Tiffany’s marked an overlooked turning point in the history of Spain. Even if the means can be questioned, the motivations were clear: to denounce the collaborative relationship between tourism and dictatorship and, furthermore, to denounce spatial exploitation. As Lefebvre outlines in his text, “Towards an Architecture of Enjoyment,” the development of the tourist industry was a process of the neo-colonization of space.10 The attack made visible the contradictions of the dictatorial regime but also unveiled the dangers of a new and upcoming form of capitalism. From Rimini to Torremolinos, the Mediterranean discotheque rendered evident the start of an era in which spatial experiences were not only to be industrially produced, but consumed en masse.
