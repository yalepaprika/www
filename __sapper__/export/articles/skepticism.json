{"title":{"rendered":"Skepticism"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I first read the topic for this issue of <i>Paprika!</i>, it filled me with anxiety. As I near the end of my architecture education, I realize that I still have no idea what this dash of something special could be. Is it the underlying formal geometry? Is it the aesthetic experience? Is it the spatial variable? Will I ever know? It seems that every time I think I know what it might be, I learn something new about architecture that changes my whole perspective on what that “secret ingredient” is. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Besides step 5, “add a dash of </span><span class=\"s2\">aaaaaaa</span><span class=\"s1\">”, the recipe offered in the prompt makes a lot of sense, and </span><span class=\"s3\">got me wondering, <i>why isn’t architecture taught in that way? </i>As a series of steps to follow, a methodology of sorts. Couldn’t design studios be set up like methods se</span><span class=\"s1\">minars? Where you are exposed to a series of approaches to solving </span><span class=\"s4\">problems, as well as their strengths </span><span class=\"s1\">and limitations, and try them out for yourself on your projects. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead, the education of archi</span>tects is filled with mystery. It’s true<span class=\"s1\"><br />\nthat there is no straight path towards gaining the knowledge you<br />\nwill need. You might learn something in a computational design seminar or a composition course that solves the problem you were scratching your head about during last semester’s studio project. But then again you would have never been able to arrive at that knowledge if you hadn’t taken last semester’s studio in the first place! It’s a catch-22. You only start to gain a sense of the full picture years after your first design studio. And even then, </span><span class=\"s4\">you might have an idea of the pieces, </span>but not always how to put them <span class=\"s3\">together. The recipe described so</span><span class=\"s1\"> clearly in this <i>Paprika!</i> issue takes </span><span class=\"s5\">years of trial and error, of fumbling </span><span class=\"s1\">and bumbling to arrive at. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s4\">An added level of enigma further exacerbates the confusion created by this non-linear form of acquiring </span><span class=\"s1\">knowledge. Architects are encour</span><span class=\"s4\">aged to present clear arguments, but</span> not to reveal their cards. The idea <span class=\"s1\">of using a recipe or methodology is contrary to everything we are told </span>about making <span class=\"s4\">Great Architecture. </span>Many architects would refuse to <span class=\"s1\">admit to using a recipe. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s4\">Perhaps the confusion arises because for every architect, the recipe is different. What changes from architect to architect is not so much<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\">the dash of something special, but rather the order and quantities of all ingredients involved. As you </span><span class=\"s3\">gain more experience and knowledge,</span><span class=\"s1\"> you add and subtract from </span><span class=\"s4\">that recipe. Some pieces of informa</span><span class=\"s1\">tion will cause you to throw the </span><span class=\"s4\">recipe out altogether. Then there is the question of gaining knowledge </span><span class=\"s3\">but not knowing what to do with</span><span class=\"s1\"> it—knowing you want your architecture to incorporate this new knowledge but not knowing how to do it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">What makes architecture special is its ability to grapple with and </span>integrate a variety of ingredients <span class=\"s1\">that do not necessarily make sense together. Maybe we shouldn’t be </span><span class=\"s4\">looking for this “special ingredient,”</span><span class=\"s1\"> but instead focus on mastering many different recipes. </span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Camille Chabrol"},"slug":"camille-chabrol","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2020"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"A Dash of ______"},"slug":"a-dash-of-______","meta":{"volume":"5","number":"19","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2020-04-23"}}}}
