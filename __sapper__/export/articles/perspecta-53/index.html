Architects exist in a comparative ethical purgatory in which designers often choose only to see their work’s broad reaching impacts if it fits their brand identity. In the face of this ambiguity, this issue of Perspecta’s stance is clear.

The timeline of architecture may be slower than the work of other disciplines, but in today’s charged climate, architecture is </span><span>propaganda</span><span>. Architecture’s language can reinforce or disturb political structures. Onus is placed on the architect to determine his or her political stance, in an era where remaining silent still denotes an ethical choice.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, considering the implications of the building industry on our planet can no longer be sequestered within the jargon of sustainability.
