Yes, we introduce visual and interactive designers early on in projects, but the whole process is design. Designers have complete agency insomuch as it doesn’t conflict with team goals.</p> <p><strong>CC</strong> Outside of Beyond, what type(s) of design do you see assigned the most value in today’s business landscape?</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Probably user interaction (UI) design. Simple, beautiful interfaces. My personal opinion is that more value should be placed on service design—the design of systems and how they work. As technology evolves, and interoperability becomes more possible through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and other means, the limits on how we connect a cohesive overall customer experience become smaller. I see designers thinking and behaving much more like architects going forward, figuring out how to build strong, interdependent structures that enable experiences for people and are truly beautiful at the same time.</p> <p><strong>CC</strong> Let’s talk about the McKinsey Design Index. On the one hand, that report from October has opened corporate eyes to the value of design, and led to more attention given to design. On the other hand, it raises questions about whether or not McKinsey, a consulting behemoth, should be dictating the value of design, as well as questions about whether or not design can and should be quantified. In your opinion, do you think design can be quantified?</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Yes, but we should exercise caution in doing it. Design is integral to many other things that can be quantified. For example, customer service relies on design, and customer service can be quantified. But the true value of design shouldn’t be defined by these quantitative measures. The real value, and the fact that it does permeate so many other aspects of business, transcends quantification.</p> <p>True design expertise requires vision, and vision relies on both intangible and tangible measures. Leaders who commit to a vision of great design should trust their gut here, and not expect a spreadsheet to tell them if they’ve achieved their goal.</p> <p><em>Claudia Reuter is the Managing Director at Techstars Accelerator.

What is the value of design in business? You’re free to interpret value and design and business however you want.</p> <p><strong>Claudia Reuter</strong> Your brand is your reputation.

Once you pick a logo, make sure it reflects your brand and that you’re consistent with it.</p> <p>At Techstars, we look at companies, especially in the industrial space, before their brands are hashed out, so there’s a huge opportunity to add value through the design of their brand.</p> <p><strong>CC</strong> Definitely. Brand is so important for a consumer-facing company. What about other types of design? How about organization design?</p> <p><strong>CR</strong> I’ve been a part of several re-orgs.
