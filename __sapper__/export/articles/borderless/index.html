Primarily located in hurricane-prone regions, the company deploys a sophisticated disaster planning and continuity team, enabling them to remain open even in the face of serious catastrophes. Their ability to withstand disasters is so renowned that our own FEMA regards the functioning of an area’s Waffle House’s as a highly accurate indicator of the severity of a given storm: alongside familiar metrics like hurricane wind-speed, the agency consults Waffle Houses status—open, green; limited menu, yellow; closed, red-alert—to help them predict how much aid a recovering community may require [Image 3].</p> <p><a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg><img height=882 src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg width=1171 alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7064" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg 1171w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex-300x226.jpg 300w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex-768x578.jpg 768w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224437/2_WaffleHouseIndex-1024x771.jpg 1024w"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>And so, lest we think that international coalitions of scientists are the sole cartographers of natural systems, along comes Waffle House to show us the often bizarre knowledge networks that come into being to chart a cross-borders problem like hurricanes. Who would’ve thought that the disaster planning experts responsible for keeping pancake supply chains up and running would inadvertently advise a government agency. When it comes to charting natural-systems, apparently the difference-maker can be something as seemingly arbitrary as a fast food company’s market extents.</p> <p>Artifact 3: RMS(one) brochure<br> In 2014, the catastrophe modeling company Risk Management Solutions launched RMS(one), a digital platform that collates numerous risk models into one overarching global dataset, allowing its users to see, in real time, the likelihood of a variety of different disasters occurring anywhere on the planet. In their brochure advertising the product, RMS produced a world map of startling novelty: other than a demarcation of broad regions via color, the map ignores boundaries completely and instead renders landmasses as constitutions of identically sized hexagons [Image 4]. In this vision, national borders do not matter; instead the earth’s surface is broken up into equal quadrants of data where what is of import is a geographic unit’s likelihood of suffering a given disaster.</p> <p><a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap.jpg><img height=1021 src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap.jpg width=2048 alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7065" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap.jpg 2048w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap-300x150.jpg 300w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap-768x383.jpg 768w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16224440/3_RMSonemap-1200x599.jpg 1200w"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>These disasters are likewise abstracted into exchangeable icons, for what matters to RMS(one)’s users are not the human and environmental costs of a catastrophe, but the financial ones. Importantly, RMS’s models calculate the potential insurance losses of a given disaster, allowing for the creation of a novel financial instrument called a “Catastrophe Bond”: investors agree to pay out the property loss claims that may accrue over a 3-5 year bond period with the understanding that, sans catastrophe, they will earn tremendous interest on their loan.</p> <p>Our assumption that a deep engagement with the environment will force a confrontation with the particular physical properties and local conditions surrounding a given natural system is thereby turned on its head: by going even deeper, to discover the statistical laws that underlie catastrophes of all stripes, RMS(one)’s models instead abstract natural disasters to turn potential destruction into a statistics-based commodity that traders can invest or de-invest in to diversify their portfolios. National borders have been voided only to be replaced by the bell curve of a probability distribution, a line potentially even more destructive than the state boundaries of the recent past.</p> <p>1 “Waffle House History,” Waffle House, https://www.wafflehouse.com/story/<br> 2 Geographer Leigh Johnson has described Cat models as “the chief technologies creating tradable contingent futures” and provides a chilling example of the callous attitudes these abstractions give rise to when she quotes a fund manager’s description of his investing strategy as the mixing of “some Cal quake with a little Japan wind.” Leigh Johnson, “Catastrophe bonds and financial risk: Securing capital and rule through contingency,” Geoforum 45, DOI:10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.04.003</p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)

Their ability to withstand disasters is so renowned that our own FEMA regards the functioning of an area’s Waffle House’s as a highly accurate indicator of the severity of a given storm: alongside familiar metrics like hurricane wind-speed, the agency consults Waffle Houses status—open, green; limited menu, yellow; closed, red-alert—to help them predict how much aid a recovering community may require [Image 3].\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7064\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1171\" height=\"882\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex.jpg 1171w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex-300x226.jpg 300w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex-768x578.jpg 768w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224437\u002F2_WaffleHouseIndex-1024x771.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, lest we think that international coalitions of scientists are the sole cartographers of natural systems, along comes Waffle House to show us the often bizarre knowledge networks that come into being to chart a cross-borders problem like hurricanes.

In their brochure advertising the product, RMS produced a world map of startling novelty: other than a demarcation of broad regions via color, the map ignores boundaries completely and instead renders landmasses as constitutions of identically sized hexagons [Image 4]. In this vision, national borders do not matter; instead the earth’s surface is broken up into equal quadrants of data where what is of import is a geographic unit’s likelihood of suffering a given disaster.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7065\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1021\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap.jpg 2048w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap-768x383.jpg 768w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https:\u002F\u002Fd2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F16224440\u002F3_RMSonemap-1200x599.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese disasters are likewise abstracted into exchangeable icons, for what matters to RMS(one)’s users are not the human and environmental costs of a catastrophe, but the financial ones. Importantly, RMS’s models calculate the potential insurance losses of a given disaster, allowing for the creation of a novel financial instrument called a “Catastrophe Bond”: investors agree to pay out the property loss claims that may accrue over a 3-5 year bond period with the understanding that, sans catastrophe, they will earn tremendous interest on their loan.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur assumption that a deep engagement with the environment will force a confrontation with the particular physical properties and local conditions surrounding a given natural system is thereby turned on its head: by going even deeper, to discover the statistical laws that underlie catastrophes of all stripes, RMS(one)’s models instead abstract natural disasters to turn potential destruction into a statistics-based commodity that traders can invest or de-invest in to diversify their portfolios.
