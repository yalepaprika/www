To Tibetan Buddhists, these landscapes are holy ⁠— sites of prayer, burial, and heritage.

The same infrastructure that brings tourists to Tibet makes them uneasy about the possibility of a lost world.

The history of these tribes is interwoven across West Africa — their migration and settlement patterns in constant dialogue with the land, their natural resources. As we moved around the metropolis of Accra, we heard various different tribal languages, a reminder that these identities supersede the superimposed colonial boundaries.</p> <p>Tsein and Williams: Tod Williams rejects blind allegiance to all man-made lines as he hurls a rental car across four lanes of traffic sans turn signals.

Up in arms, the territorial moms and dads of La Jolla drive the placid beasts off with extreme tactics; some even butt out on seal rump.
