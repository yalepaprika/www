We are giving ourselves up for an exploitation of our personal wishes.

What are the implications of your speculations?</p> <p><span><strong>AJ+JA:</strong> We try to look at the ways emerging technologies interact with the environment and everyday life, and use a kind of rapid prototyping because that’s the only way we can keep up with the here and now.

This is just our quick, hastily cobbled back-of-the-napkin list, certainly not an exhaustive one. The point is that you can, within your contexts and environments, be tactical, creative and innovative, in order to leverage power. So, advocate data ownership for consumers.
