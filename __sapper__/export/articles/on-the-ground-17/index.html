We salute JASON ENGLAND and MICHAEL FERGUSON at YPPS and the staff of TYCO for their formidable and expedient work. Hats off to BIMAL MENDIS, the indomitable ROSALIE BERNARDI of the 3rd floor and JESSICA ELLIOTT (M.Arch ‘16) and MEGHAN ROYSTER (M.Arch ‘18) upstairs for this year’s On Campus Recruiting, known colloquially as the great RAMSA-hire-a-thon 2016.</span></p> <p><span>3/28: During his Monday night lecture, amidst images of tree-plantings and bark-coated walls, STIG L. ANDERSSON’s draws a line in the dirt: “Architecture and Landscape are separate. There is no synthesis.”</span></p> <p><span>3/29: During KARLA BRITTON’S ‘Construction of Exactitude’ seminar, guest speaker KENT BLOOMER recalls the horrors of modernism: “One of those things very disturbing about the International Style, for those who lived it, was continuity. Things never stopped.”</span></p> <p><span>3/30: “You are putting out something confrontational, rather than something easy to read,” said MARK OPPENHEIMER about our often unusual graphics at a lunchtime critique of Paprika! MARTA CALDEIRA pointed out she reads us online now (<a href=http://api.yalepaprika.com/subscribe/ >sign up for our e-mailer</a>!) But MARGARET SPILLANE enjoyed the challenge: “I was almost in tears, I was so happy to read it.”</span></p> <p><span>3/31: “The resources here should not be used to produce mere professionals,” posited MARK FOSTER GAGE as he led his seminar in a discussion of how to cross the threshold and create an iconic building. “Do you want to cross the threshold?” Everyone raised their hand.

Though the overflow rooms are at capacity, YSoA representatives are in attendance for Butler’s exploration of grievability (or the right to be grieved) of the individual on the first day, followed by a study of the ‘phantasmagoria of racism’ on the second. Butler recounts specific details of recent police violence, bound to the Black Lives Matter movement, in order to place texts by Foucault, Fanon, and Benjamin within her ‘matrix of grievability’.</span></p> <p><span>3/31: FRANCINE HOUBEN, of the Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo, humbles us: “At the end, Martin Luther King is more important than Mies Van der Rohe.” “That’s dangerous,” responds Dean ROBERT A.M. STERN. Houben presented her firm’s recent work, beginning with a tribute to the bold tenacity of her friend ZAHA HADID. Stern noted that Houben will likely return to Yale as a visiting professor in the near future.</span></p> <p><span>4/1 “It’s like a two decade long one liner joke,” was said of Post-modernism at the Device seminar, where DAVID TURTURO (PhD) argued that its corner detail made the Seagram’s building postmodern, “Syracuse has more chance of winning tomorrow than you have of floating that idea,” shot back PETER EISENMAN.</span></p> <p><span>4/1: Students sick of Systems class excused themselves to attend the first ever Built Environment Symposium in Kroon Hall, organized by KATHERINE STEGE and MEGHAN LEWIS of YSoA and F&ES. Speakers included alumni and affiliates of both schools, such as our own ALAN ORGANSCHI, Aclima founder RUBEN HERZL, BILLIE FAIRCLOTH from Kieran Timberlake, and GSD’s KIEL MOE. Sharing experience in research, practice, and pedagogy, and touching upon architecture, entrepreneurship, environmental studies, and urban design, the speakers had one hundred and eighty attendees signed up.</span></p> <p><span>4/1: No joke: the Apartment Crawl ended when the police decided to join the festivities.</span></p> <p><span>4/2: DEBORAH BERKE met with every single student (except the undergraduates, PhD and M.E.D. students), in groups of 20 for one hour each, ending the day by treating everyone to beer and pizza at Gpscy. </span></p> <p><span>4/2: A grant snafu means that the first years will have to learn some architectural magic tricks.
