I would have believed them if they had told me that it was Dorothy’s house, just blown up from the Kansas prairie.

While things had seemed normal enough outside, suddenly everyone stood in italics, their bodies at a 45-degree angle to the floor, sneakers bent up like little dog ears.

The Mystery Area had delivered on its promise. Gravity truly did not work here.</p> <p>They told us that even they couldn’t quite explain it, but floated several theories. It could be the strange earth metals deep underfoot. It might be unseen electric forces. It was perhaps even the work of supernatural beings. They did not suggest the possible involvement of aliens, a trap into which too many a good hoax has fallen. The story remained just on the edge of believability. I asked questions intently. My friends made fun of me.<br> Of course, gravity was working perfectly well that day. As was the illusion of its malfunction. The Mystery Area is, frankly put, a simple variation on the gravity hill or the Ames room, the essential premise being that when the horizon line is obscured, precluding us from our bearings, and the landscape is slanted, we perceive downhill to be uphill. It is an uncomplicated illusion, but the true power of the Mystery Area is not the sight of such a deception, it is the feeling of it. Standing inside that wonky house, I knew to not trust my eyes. It is much harder, however, to distrust our visceral sense of the world. If we do, there is little else we can count on.

However, because it claims to be magic in the mystical sense, it can never reveal itself to be otherwise, and so forfeits its architectural merit. This is why no drawings of the Mystery Area exist. A drawing would reveal the place to be architecture; it would admit that there are strings. Instead, it lives out its existence as architecture pretending to be mysticism. Architecture may be magical, but it is not mystical. When we pretend that it is, our buildings are no better than a roadside attraction.</p> <p>Then again, there is something strange about the Mystery Area. Not that it really is mystical. I won’t imply that in polite conversation. But it’s not architecture either. It isn’t merely strings. In fact, I would argue that in some way, the Mystery Area is wholly unarchitectural, in that it is beside the point to speak about how it works in the first place. It does not matter how it works because the sensation is no less unsettling when one understands the trick.
