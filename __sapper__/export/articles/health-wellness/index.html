The YSOA operates in a high demand, high judgment, high stress environment nearly every day, which has a significant impact on how we function. Anxiety, depression, and other syndromes abound, including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which we commonly joke about, but rarely discuss in any sort of serious manner. According to a 2013 survey conducted by the National Institute of Health, approximately one in four American adults suffers from a mental illness, which refers to anything from generalized anxiety disorder to schizophrenia. If we were to misappropriate this statistic and map it onto the School of Architecture student body, it would mean that about 55 of your 220 classmates are dealing with some sort of mental health concern. That’s about equal to an entire M.Arch I class. If we take into account the amount of added stress that we endure here and the fact that Architecture as a discipline attracts a certain type of personality, we’d speculate that this number may be much higher. </span></p> <p><span>It’s important that as a community, we begin to de-stigmatize mental health at the School of Architecture and speak openly about how it affects our school culture and personal relationships. If you’re personally dealing with anxiety for instance, whether it’s rooted in academics, social situations, or something entirely different, it’s critical to be able to speak with someone about it, whether that be a friend, mentor, or professional counselor or doctor.

Gone unaddressed, mental health problems can manifest in substance abuse issues, eating disorders, academic difficulties, and even more serious conditions. As we develop work habits that will set the stage for how we practice in the professional realm, it’s important to remember that we’re also developing life habits. Issues that develop now are likely to stick around if not addressed.
