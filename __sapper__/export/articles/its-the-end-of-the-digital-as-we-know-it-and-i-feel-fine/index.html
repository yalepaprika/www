The processes involved in moving your fingers to access this particular page, for instance, is a process so complex, and involving such vast quantities of information in the form of sensory feedback, textural processing, pressure and friction calculations, logistics of temperature, balance, and position in space, that it is impossible to accurately reproduce using all of the world’s current digital prowess and robotic intelligence.  In fact our current efforts a reproducing human muscle movement using digital and robotic technologies, however important and brilliant, usually result in stumbling, drunken machinations that can barely walk much less navigate the delicate page of a simple newspaper. That is to say, as far as complexity, efficiency, control, nuance of movement, and ability to actually do and make things, your finger can still give the digital…well…the finger.  So why does the digital hold such allure to architects?

As such architecture can be partially forgiven for making the accompanying sweeping promises of a future vastly reconfigured by these innovations.  The problem with the continual onslaught of such promises is that the digital has spawned not only a wealth of new and fantastic tools– but an entire new genre of architectural fortunetellers that seem content to merely make futuristic architectural claims on the digital’s behalf– as opposed to doing the actual, productive, research that might turn such a future into a real present. This is unfortunate, as it places architecture’s successes just around the corner, leaving us with a rather unattended and unremarkable architectural present.  </span></p> <p><span>We have all heard the claims: “All buildings will soon be 3d printed on site!” “Social and political interconnectivity through Parametricism!” “Cities made of mushrooms are just around the corner!”  At a certain point, however, it might be worth placing a finger on the pause button of speculative claims, for the sake of an increasingly desperate present, and take a sensationalism-free assessment of the digital and what it has, in fact, done, and what it can do for us, for humanity, now. </span></p> <p><span>Architecture’s shift from making to speculating—from builders to futurists, is leaving our actual architectural fabric, devastatingly undersigned. While it is exciting to see architectural speculators on TED stages and in sensational publications extolling how buildings will now be grown from beef, how genetically engineered skyscrapers will clean the air like giant oyster reefs, how cities will be assembled from parametrically placed fungi, and how structures will be woven by silkworms, or extruded from spider-goat silk (all actual recent speculations), the truth is an emphasis on such narratives shift architecture from a discipline of the physical to a discipline of the verbal. As a profession, our speculations have become exciting enough to eclipse our current reality, and our tools have become so sophisticated at allowing us to visualize just about anything, that we are beginning to mistake storytelling bolstered by polished renderings or cheap lobby installations for actual research and actual, physical, architecture.      </span></p> <p><span>As far as speculations on what digital technology will enable, the ugly truth is actually that the digital has been most influential not in the creative or design aspects of architecture, but its financial machinations—its tracking, cost estimating, product procurement and efficiencies of time-saving assembly.  For all of the promise of 3d printing, robotic stacking, and CNC milling, parametric scripting and biological computation, it’s been the excel spreadsheet and product-linked BIM model that are the actual legacy of the digital in contemporary practice. And so we see a split—the promise of digital dreams foretold by architectural futurists who produce effervescent words sprinkled with the occasional lobby installation or museum object, and the actual use of the digital, in the form vast spreadsheets that track the cost and placement of every brick, and BIM models that manage money, limit available geometries, and promise to transform architecture into the act of arranging off-the-shelf products into big, dumb, LEED-certified boxes.  </span></p> <p><span>The future of the profession lies neither in saving even more money or making construction even more efficient, nor making even wilder claims about fleetingly distant futures.  Architecture’s actual future needs to be a fusion of these two trajectories into, again, a single profession neither digging its heels into the sand nor, like Icarus, flying too close to an unreachable sun. Digital technologies are not only the spur to both of these strains of practice—the efficient and the speculative, but as a common language it is the only hope for their possible remarriage.</span></p> <p><span>Architecture is among the most complex and resource-intensive endeavors of humankind. It is complicated beyond the ability for any single person to understand its true extents as a discipline or as a singular endeavor.
