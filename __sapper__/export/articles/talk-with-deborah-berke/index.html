But, asked one student, how does the current structure of the major help/inhibit that interdisciplinary goal? Berke said that she has been aware of this question since the early days of her deanship and would like to put together a committee to tackle the challenge. It is clear that most students at Yale live “at least 3 lives”, and some of the emphasis on studio should be lightened.

How can we change internally and externally? For Berke, the YSoA can take advantage of its unique position in the public eye to influence pedagogy throughout the world. The changes that it makes will set a standard for similar architecture programs.
