Still, the built environment forms a crucial background in a tale that constantly oscillates between tragedy and childhood abandon.

The precarity of the lives of Moonee and her comrades constantly shifts in and out of focus, brought to an uncomfortable clarity and then obscured by the afternoon’s adventure. In the end, the film is not a critique of the vast real estate empire that is Disney, whose presence almost becomes incidental after a while, but the inertia of public authorities in their ability to provide affordable housing. The burning condo becomes an obvious foil to Magic Castle and Future Inn,the beloved motels of the film’s characters, signalling the decay of all permanent options.

It doesn’t seek to evaluate the architectural typologies that correlate with homeownership or housing insecurity, but in making them integral to the well-crafted cinematography of the film, these structures become embedded with a significance that transcends their formal eccentricities. The perspective of a bunch of energetic, often-annoying children may not be the most obvious analytical standpoint when evaluating highway America.
