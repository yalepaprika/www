From contemporary hip-hop sampling to the recent return a Po-Mo Grey-ness under the guise of cartoons and archives, the use and abuse of history is very much in the air, driven by what can only be understood as a profound and persistent sense of loss and longing—a search for tradition and identity in a world increasingly decentered and unstable.
