Starting from an issue of individuality and high wall in Indonesian housing, we tried in this project to imagine some plot that could happen in the new intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span>One example is &#8216;how high is our fence&#8217;. This plot evokes an idea of interaction and intimacy between user and neighbors.</span></p>\n<p><span>What if in the afternoon the user can enjoy food from street vendor, have a chat, and enjoy activities in their terrace?</span></p>\n<p><span>We love the idea that stories could help us to see from different perspective, adding more meaning/value to the design and users in poetic ways.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Dua Office"},"slug":"dua-office","meta":{"degree":" ","graduation_year":""}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Frame + Essence"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"16","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-02-23"}}}}
