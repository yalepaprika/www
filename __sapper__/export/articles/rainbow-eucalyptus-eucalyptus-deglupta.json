The tree is native to the Philippines, the only eucalyptus that grows in the northern hemisphere, and is an explosive display of technicolor. I remember googling it and thinking it belonged on a Dr. Seuss set. Feast your eyes on its psychedelic trunk, akin to the aftermath of a unicorn’s sneeze or a VW van from the 60s. The fluorescent colors may seem out of place, even “unnatural” at first, but its magnificence will sink in and suddenly, you will be left wondering: why don’t more trees shed their bark and show off their chlorophyll magic?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Colors include: slime green, Barney the Dinosaur purple, Rex the Dinosaur green, Lorax orange, Oliver Sacks’ indigo, Clifford the Big Red Dog red, Big Bird yellow, Dora the Explorer pink.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Rhea Schmid"},"slug":"rhea-schmid","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2020"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Trees"},"slug":"trees","meta":{"volume":"5","number":"17","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2020-04-02"}}}}
