We looked into the eyes of women who had just stepped out into the free world after thirty-five years, and we met twenty-year-olds sentenced for life.

Prison architecture in America is essentially mean—these lifeless buildings of concrete and metal are built to separate, control, and punish. Therefore, in order to present a thorough critique of the architecture of American prisons today, it became imperative to completely reassess the typology. For most of us, this meant fundamentally rewriting the idea of incarceration. What did a restorative facility look like? What new way of framing the issue could lead to a more positive and more productive time in prison? What was possible?

One student, for example, tackled the issue of illiteracy among the prison population; another, the problem of mental health. As a result, many projects appropriated themes and ideas pertaining to other typologies—schools, for example, or clinics—in an attempt to rethink the prison as a more restorative and productive institution, aimed towards betterment rather than punishment. We chose specific words like “park,” “path,” “college,” “house,” “dorm,” and “commune” to frame our projects in a way that broadened the idea of what a prison building could be, allowing us to reimagine this institution in a more progressive way. </span></p> <p><span>This semantic reconceptualization was not limited to our individual projects, but extended to all our discussions regarding the topic of incarceration: we called inmates “residents”, guards were “correctional officers”, cells were “rooms,” etc. It was a collective exercise in reformulating the lexicon of prison architecture in an attempt to assert a sense of humanity and of compassion—an enterprise strongly supported by Frank, who exhorted us throughout the whole semester to be empathetic, and to use emotion as the guiding light of our designs. </span></p> <p><span>In this sense, Bill Keller’s account of our end-of-semester presentation seems to have misunderstood the fundamental idea behind our intentional—albeit idealistic—projection of prisons into other dimensions of existence, be these of educational establishments, health facilities, communal apartments, or workshops.

In addition, doing so would have meant accepting a two-century-long roster of crippling projects, stretching from the terrifying notions of isolation and repentance found in the Quaker prototypes—the Eastern State and Auburn Penitentiaries—to the obsession over control in Bentham’s Panopticon.
