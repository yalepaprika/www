Plenty of other sacred spaces have been devastated without that much media coverage or donation money flowing in. I love buildings / sacred sites and think they are worth preserving for future generations, but that whole episode seemed really imbalanced.</p>\n<p><em>If you were a plant, what kind would you be?</em><br />\nGhost pipe<br />\nStrawberry palm tree<br />\nRedwood Cedar<br />\nFicus<br />\nPohutukawa tree<br />\nPolka dot plant<br />\nAnemone<br />\nLilium japonicum<br />\nOrchid<br />\nhoneysuckle<br />\nBamboo<br />\nA hydrangea<br />\nOne of those windswept Monterey Cypress trees that grow along Highway 1.<br />\ncogongrass<br />\nFern<br />\njasmine vine<br />\nA fuzzy little cactus<br />\nginkgo biloba</p>\n<p><em>What is your favorite texture or pattern?</em><br />\nsplatter paint on bicycles<br />\nStripes<br />\nBark<br />\nEvenly spaced dots<br />\nsomething rough a gritty like volcanic rock<br />\nstippling<br />\nWhite noise<br />\nterrazzo (for now)<br />\nGrid ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;m basic<br />\ntexture: rounded wood dowels (wall application)<br />\nNatural sisal texture, absolutely blank no pattern pattern<br />\nPhoto scan of autoclaved aerated concrete<br />\nLinen<br />\nnatural<br />\nLight through rippling water<br />\nSuede all the frickin way!!!<br />\nWaffle towel<br />\nIt is hard to pick a favorite.
