In “’Other’ Activism,” Jacqueline Hall explores the instrumentality of space and spatial theories and their protocols in the construction of identity and subjectivity. In “Current Location” Nicholas de Monchaux addresses the question of the city as a complex networked artifact: “how information, cities, and resilience can be considered together and how many different kinds of resilience––all interconnected and each one essential––can be imagined and created in concert.” In “Instrument/ality: Instru/mentality,” Professor Peggy Deamer engages all three prompts by proposing that the gap between the instruments for architecture and the instrumentality of architecture by capitalism is and must be a space of agency. In “Rethinking the Synthesis of Form as an </span><i><span>Objectively</span></i><span> Subjective Design Process,” Christopher Leung draws parallels between Christopher Alexander’s </span><i><span>Synthesis of Form</span></i><span> and Patrick Schumacher’s strategy of </span><i><span>autopoiesis</span></i><span> and investigates the relationship between the instrumentality of systems and design intuition.
