The first essay serves as the introduction while setting a clear frame of reference for the rest of the book. The author defines Rio as a “city of epithets” such epithets, in the past, have included </span><i><span>Cidade Maravilhosa</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Porto Maravilha</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Cidade Integrada</span></i><span>; and more recently, Olympic city.

Moreover, the essay points out that Favela branding helps create ‘specificity’. The result is either a thrilling effect or downplaying the relevant concerns embedded in favelas. However, how </span><span>favelas </span><span>are affected exactly by the attention is not fully elaborated. How did favela dwellers adapt to their new roles?

Paramount to understanding the politics behind the grand Olympic master plan is comprehending the socio-economic makeup of the Barra da Tijuca to which the Olympic master plan would expand to create the </span><span>Olympic village</span><span>. The population of this neighborhood contains the “new rich”. Here the essay also focuses on how local favelas have capitalized by starting their own rental system to accommodate the </span><span>influx of labor t</span><span>o the site. The focus on this topic is crucial to understanding a different side of the story that isn’t simply about favela evictions. However, what happens after the construction is more difficult to guess.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the essays discuss the protests and the possibility of bottom-up strategies in the </span><span>built environment realm</span><span>s from multiple angles. The occupied streets are posing a question to these writers, which is precisely “who has the right to public spaces?” Rio’s proposed future and its exclusivity have rendered many stranded and forgotten, which results in the incredible </span><span>solidarity</span><span> through protests on the streets, plazas, and parks. Take the Parque Madureira for example. Like most Olympic era constructions, this park was meant to brand Rio as a place of leisure and fitness.When the park was taken over by protesters against police brutality, the layered narratives became incredibly powerful. The media coverage of these protests has elevated their visibility, which in turn increased the political weight of the protests.
