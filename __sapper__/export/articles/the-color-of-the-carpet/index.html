No one did before the 2008 renovation, during which the carpet, nearly forgotten, was resurrected from a 3/4” x 1 1/2” swatch found under a filing cabinet in former Associate Dean John Jacobson’s office, perfectly preserved. After its years of absence, Dean Stern was particularly proud of the debut which brought the carpet to more spaces than original and “gave the cold concrete a warm glow.”[1] It reflected light, as Rudolph always intended, “[making] the floor appear to rise or float in contrast to the heavy corrugated concrete walls, [stimulating] the eyes of the viewer.”[2]</p> <p>To Rudolph, the carpet was “orange,” perhaps even “bright orange”—an active, creative, expressive hue selected in collaboration with Boston-based interior designer Bill Bagnall, and undoubtedly inspired by a trending interest in color theory and the new presence of Josef Albers at the School of Art.[3] After the fire in 1969, the ruined carpet became yet another symbol of an era past, replaced by an institutional brownish burgundy until the restoration in ‘08.

I mean, of course, it isn’t. The old carpet was wool and the color discontinued. Meanwhile, the new fibers are synthetic, the hue “closely matched,” not exact. In the course of our conversation, Jacobson even<br> suggested the swatch-from-under-the-filing-cabinet was a different hue entirely, more yellow-y orange than red orange. “I think at some point, when we were reviewing the color match options, Bob just chose which orange he wanted to be the orange,” he recalled.

The paprika carpet today, in the 4th floor pit—worn down by shoes chasing shuttlecocks, cookie crumbs from lunchtime talks, and perhaps even a tipped over, un-sanctioned coffee or two—is nothing like it was fresh in 1963, 2008, or even what it will be, after it’s all replaced again when we return in the fall. In “paprika,” Dean Stern both rebranded the carpet and constructed a tangible image for YSoA, one pulled together, in all of its difference, against our undoubtedly loud, idiosyncratic variant of orange.
