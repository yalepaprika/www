The exhibition invited architects to act out scenes based on the Lobby’s 10 point manifesto in order to present the absurdities of architectural labor (for example, learning during a job interview that the internship you’re seeking is unpaid). Event coordinators included KEEFER DUNN (IIT), MANUEL SHVARTZBERG (GSAPP), QUILIAN RIANO (DSGN AGNC), and ELAINA BERKOWITZ (MArch ‘17). The three day event culminated with a Halloween party.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E10\u002F31\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe First Years visited Bushwick, New York to see the site of their last project of the term: a library on a triangular site at a confluence of a gentrifying area.
