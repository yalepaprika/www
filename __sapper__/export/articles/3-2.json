{"title":{"rendered":"7 things"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span>A silly sign I love by the coffee machine is titled &#8220;Most Difficult Yet Comforting Things to Accept about Life&#8221;. There are 7 things. #3 states: &#8220;There is always someone better than you. So there&#8217;s no point to compare.&#8221; I think many people would read this and think itâ€™s depressing. I find it uplifting and I think a big part of that is what that statement doesn&#8217;t say. It doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;so give up&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;so work harder&#8221;. It simply suggests you accept and don&#8217;t compare. The benefit of not comparing should be self-evident. But the benefit of accepting is no less important. I&#8217;m heartened by the idea that there are people better than me at what I do. I gives me something to strive to, someone to learn from and most importantly, someone to seek out and collaborate with. But no less important, it reminds me that I don&#8217;t need to be the best, and that&#8217;s OK. Not being the best means you have room to get better. So just do your best and don&#8217;t compare.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Post"},"slug":"post","meta":{"volume":"2","number":"15","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-02-09"}}}}
