Through nearly 40 semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and a social network analysis of virtual platform users, my study explores the factors influencing the spread of local policy action among more than half a dozen Indonesian member cities of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), an eight-year Rockefeller Foundation initiative.
