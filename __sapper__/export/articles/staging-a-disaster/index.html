These aren’t actors then, but reenactors, and they require the architectural accoutrements that best emulate their prescriptive environments.</p> <p><span>Likewise, emergency personnel with ballooning budgets and ever-evolving threats of terrorism and natural disasters require simulated training environments just as accurate as their real-life counterparts, but that are capable of being thrown into confused devastation at will. In this effort, emergency personnel have found disaster film sets a more than suitable substitution. </span></p> <p><span>The architectures of these simulations are therefore endowed with a responsibility to “get it right,” to both use the knowledge of its actors (or participants) to inform the environment, and use the authenticity of the environment to inform its actors.</span></p> <p><span>This produces a perplexing identity crisis, something Kaufman-esque, that is, the positioning of the simulation within the frame of the real that prefigures it, forcing the real to defend its realness through the framework of the simulation, which the simulation then appropriates to validate its own authenticity.</span><span> Take the example of the following quote from the making of the film “</span><i><span>World Trade Center</span></i><span>” (Paramount Pictures, 2006)</span></p> <p>“They used some of the rescue workers in the filming.

It is therefore not farfetched to imagine a city that acts like a city, that is informed by, and informs, a real counterpart. Within these spaces, it is possible to elucidate new understandings of the relation of architecture to the urban traumatic event where—even though infused with the postmodern rhetoric of simulation—they are indelibly tied to suffering and death, and therefore act and produce with extreme sincerity.    </span></p> <p><span>Like the remake of a film, the simulation perpetuates via consensus,</span><span> cyclically informing its own disruptions through which it revises its architectures.
