The team’s fundraising efforts produced two-thirds of that final amount but were unable to find the remainder to allow their construction contract to be processed.

Things took a paranormal turn when Kate McMillan, a project manager, unknowingly attempted to contact the dead during one of many alumni cold-calling sessions.
