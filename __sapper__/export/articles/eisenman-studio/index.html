A way to get at that power is to deny symmetry, and the diptych offers a way to explore that.

First, the computer has taken over as the new authority. Second, we don’t have any more giants in the field. When I was in school, Frank Lloyd Wright was the giant. Then it was Louis Kahn, then Le Corbusier, Aldo Rossi, Jim Stirling, Michael Graves…there was always a dominant figure. Authority is a necessary condition for resistance. Therefore, I argue that we need to resurrect authority. I teach and write about Palladio and Alberti because history acknowledges them as giants, and it’s better to learn something about them than learn about someone “of the moment” who is not an authority figure.<br> I write, I practice, I teach. Those are the three things I think are important as a model of behavior. I assume that the students who take my studio understand that this is one way rather than the only way.
