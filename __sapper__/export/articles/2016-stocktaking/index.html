At YSOA, this tension is consistently palpable and often entertaining, but I think we can do better to have productive discussions and collaborations.

In a time of ever more complex and pressing world issues, how could you argue against comprehensive analysis when working within the built environment? For the traditionalists, can’t form itself respond to holistic assessment, and shouldn’t it acknowledge changing times? Vidler proposes an “Ecological Bauhaus,”<a href=#_ftn8 name=_ftnref8><sup>[8]</sup></a> a vision for architectural education that would pool the knowledge of formalists, landscape designers, urban designers, urban ecologists, and conservationists into a pedagogy that might begin to tackle the spatial problems of global warming, densifying cities, and urban slum conditions that he says architects must confront to survive.
