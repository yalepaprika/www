The walls were adorned with male erotic art—fisting being the major theme—paired with paraphernalia from leather bars that had closed their doors previously, such as the Why Not, Tool Box, and the Red Star Saloon. The dress code was limited to leather harnesses, jocks, socks, cockrings, or “nothing at all.” This was reinforced by Steve who raised the heat to just above room temperature. </span><i><span>Just</span></i><span> comfortable for the nude body (Rubin 228).</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the foyer was the “Bridal Suite” with a bed, and lastly, the dungeon complete with wood floors, exposed wood beams and posts, imparting a medieval air. The bed was the “ideal spot for those public displays of special intimacy” (Rubin 229). A hospital gurney hung from the ceiling by chains for more mobile intimacies, and a wooden bondage cross occupied the center of the room, springing from one of the support pillars. All tools and accessories delivered participants a graceful weightlessness. Acts were oft paired with religious iconography (the flagellation cross or religious robes).</span></p> <p><span>The Catacombs provided a comfortable and familial dungeon experience; product of the context and spaces that were affordable, private and out-of-the-way.Not all venues performed in the same manner. In New York, the Mineshaft rose to meet the needs of urbanites in the 70’s testing the limits of their sexuality in the dark corners and back-alleys of a much cruder locale.  Sexual acts took place in locations ranging “from the dangerously public cruising grounds of parks and restrooms (tearooms) to the decaying piers along the Hudson River” (Moore 16).</span></p> <p><span>Private clubs, discos, and bathhouses provided moderately protected sites for sexual exploration.  At the extreme end of gay, male sexual practices, leather was taken up “enthusiastically”, although inappropriately characterized as the “superficial trappings [that] easily melded to stereotypical gay male interests—theatricality, costuming, and…a worship of all that is masculine” (Moore 18). The Mineshaft “functioned as a sort of main “set” for the playing out of powerful fantasies” (Moore 19).</span></p> <p><span>Owned by the “godfather of leather sensibility” Wally Wallace, The Mineshaft blossomed in Manhattan’s (then) shady Meat Packing District (Moore 19). Moore asserts that the “district was, at the time, largely deserted at night, with the processing plants shuttered, scraps of meat and fat laying on greasy streets, and sharp hooks swaying empty on tracks used during the day to transport from trucks into the shops…” (Moore 21). Violent and vulgar, one could nearly miss the unmarked door of a post industrial building leading up into the club proper (Moore 22).  Doormen at the top rejected patrons wearing “dress pants or smelling of cologne”.</span></p> <p><span>The bar received clientele and acted as a transition into the “slings, restraints, and a “glory-holed wall” (Moore 22). Dim and silent, save the occasional guttural moan or whispered command, this dungeon space disassociated and liberated the individual. The passion invested in the act committed ruled the day in dungeon space, and “the worship of that considered ugly by the straight world was another kind of revolt against traditionalism [and societal norm], made all the more powerful…[when predicated] on deep emotional need rather than passing style” (Moore 26).</span></p> <p><span>Sensationalism associated with S/M practices, links acts with the pains of social ostracization and exclusion, and the irrational denial of sexual orientations and desires via the misinterpretation of Christian doctrines. S/M enables pleasure outside of the procreative act, while the body in western culture is woefully tied to “means of production,” not providing “a mirror of the self” (Carrette 8). The practice contends with the inclinations our society has toward efficient lifestyles; a Taylorist model where pain, confusion, and pleasure are rationalized out and replaced by superficial and vapid entertainments that can be easily commoditized and marketed. Prevailing norms undermine not only the masturbatory quality of the act—as a means of personal enjoyment and self-love—but also touch on a “concern with lifestyle” (Carrette 9).</span></p> <p><span>What the normative community fears about perverse relations is “not the bodily acts they may get up to but the consequent issues of </span><i><span>lifestyle</span></i><span>, the </span><i><span>techniques</span></i><span> of the self, the communities established from such relations of pleasure, [and the] subsequent social exchanges” that result (Carrette 9). While intimate pleasure and bodily contact rekindle personal connections between participants, normative lifestyles and models systematically deconstruct these relations. The desire for and exchange of pleasure inevitably forms bonds based on “deep trust” surrounding intense intimacies, defining and forming a close-knit fringe culture (Carrette 9).    </span></p> <p><span>The Mineshaft and The Catacombs fall under the category of S/M, characterized by acts of self-establishment, but present radically different sexual experiences. Tactical performances work against a prevailing norm predicated on a code of conduct meant to broadcast “shared” morals and ethics. Both venues exploit out-of-the-way venues for intense personal experiences that allow the playing-out of various latent desires. Ideally, these fringe venues break-down the ever-increasing distance between bodies in relationship to normative values, or form and design. Today, the body and consciousness is fragmented by digital objects and media that are meant to negotiate the distance between bodies, form, and material, and it is increasingly necessary to reconsider the essential importance of what S/M acts embody. They maintain an intimate, unmediated connection between the senses, the body, and the corporeal existence of others. We should not allow ourselves to be disgusted with or disillusioned by our physical existence in favor of a “clean”, hyper-rendered, hyper-rationalized reality.</span></p> <p><b><i>Image Captions:</i></b></p> <p><i><span>The Ecstasy of St. Teresa </span></i><span>by Bernini. “Bataille reflects that the St. may have experienced an intense venereal orgasm in lieu of a religious transverberation..”</span></p> <p><i><span>SOMA Leather Bar 1978</span></i><span>.  Equivalent to the main room and bar of </span><i><span>The Mineshaft</span></i><span>.

Prevailing norms undermine not only the masturbatory quality of the act—as a means of personal enjoyment and self-love—but also touch on a “concern with lifestyle” (Carrette 9).\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhat the normative community fears about perverse relations is “not the bodily acts they may get up to but the consequent issues of \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Elifestyle\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E, the \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Etechniques\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E of the self, the communities established from such relations of pleasure, [and the] subsequent social exchanges” that result (Carrette 9). While intimate pleasure and bodily contact rekindle personal connections between participants, normative lifestyles and models systematically deconstruct these relations. The desire for and exchange of pleasure inevitably forms bonds based on “deep trust” surrounding intense intimacies, defining and forming a close-knit fringe culture (Carrette 9).    \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Mineshaft and The Catacombs fall under the category of S\u002FM, characterized by acts of self-establishment, but present radically different sexual experiences. Tactical performances work against a prevailing norm predicated on a code of conduct meant to broadcast “shared” morals and ethics. Both venues exploit out-of-the-way venues for intense personal experiences that allow the playing-out of various latent desires. Ideally, these fringe venues break-down the ever-increasing distance between bodies in relationship to normative values, or form and design. Today, the body and consciousness is fragmented by digital objects and media that are meant to negotiate the distance between bodies, form, and material, and it is increasingly necessary to reconsider the essential importance of what S\u002FM acts embody. They maintain an intimate, unmediated connection between the senses, the body, and the corporeal existence of others. We should not allow ourselves to be disgusted with or disillusioned by our physical existence in favor of a “clean”, hyper-rendered, hyper-rationalized reality.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage Captions:\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Ecstasy of St. Teresa \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eby Bernini. “Bataille reflects that the St. may have experienced an intense venereal orgasm in lieu of a religious transverberation..”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ESOMA Leather Bar 1978\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E.  Equivalent to the main room and bar of \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Mineshaft\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E.
