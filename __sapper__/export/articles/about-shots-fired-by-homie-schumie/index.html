You’re stuck in the 19th century if you think Aesthetics is the same as Pater and Wilde’s Aestheticism. Aesthetics is a form of engagement, and as it turns out, a rather powerful one culturally, socially and politically— as we are only now learning in more depth. Even Plato recognized this– exiling as he did artists and poets from his ideal state by reason of their political agency. Nobody is proposing an 1968 anti-capitalist position as much as an anti-vast-inequality one. As Zizek reminds us, capitalism isn’t going anywhere– and that’s not everyone’s goal, certainly not mine. But one thing that capitalism is great at is producing vast inequality, and aesthetics plays a role in this, and in a great many other things. Architecture may not be the answer to this — but architects, philosophers, artists, scholars, writers, curators and activists may have something to say to each other about the subject. That’s what my symposium is about– discussion. If the future allows for other forms of speculation, you need to open your mind. Come. I’ll save you a seat in the front row next to me. One where I can keep an eye on you so you don’t misbehave and start ranting… If it’s all solved and architecture is over–having reached it’s pinnacle with Patrikmetricism, then by all means, keep manslaining the world to everyone from the exalted all-knowing position that you occupy. But perhaps also be reminded by Hamlet, “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” (Act 1, scene 5,…)</span></p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[{},null,{article:{title:{rendered:"about shots fired by homie Schumie"},content:{rendered:"\u003Cp\u003EOn Facebook:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EPatrik Schumacher\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ESeptember 30 at 6:25pm · London, United Kingdom\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAN IVORY TOWER DRIPPING IN THEORETICAL ACTIVISM\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EForthcoming Yale symposium Aesthetic Activism “casts aesthetics as the primary discourse for social, ecological, and political engagement.
