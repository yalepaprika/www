The 2015 Bass Studio asked two things of us: (1) Execute an architectural intention in a non-indulgent design environment and (2) Risk empathy and experimentation when faced with the seeming banality of a single, small-ish building on a real site. In a real community, city, consumer economy, etc., etc. We pitted nascent design ideas against immutable realities (courtesy of Jonathan Rose’s genial yet firm rebuttals) of policy, finance, and the notion that new ideas can and should be “proven” in a design studio. Sisyphus had it so good. Sara and Everardo, our warrior-practitioner profs, challenged us to confront the deceptive membrane that separates the academic studio from the possibly grating, pedantic actuality of designing in the real world.
