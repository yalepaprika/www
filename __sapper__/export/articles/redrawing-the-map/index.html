So follows a longing for an idyllic “Shangri-La” and its “primitive and unspoiled state” – a textbook instance of the kind of Orientalism identified by Said for its harmful perpetuation of cultural hegemony, which has persisted well after the fall of the empires.

Curiously, all of the author’s examples of mass tourism are situated in the Western hemisphere. It is as if no cruise ships dock at Bali, no bachelor parties prowl the streets of Thailand, no daily crowds swarm Angkor Wat (an example of the neo-colonialist trappings of contemporary tourism that both cripples and supports newly independent countries is on the very same page of the </span><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> issue.) The problem of mass travel unleashed by an increasingly permeable world is a global one, making it everyone’s responsibility to find in an inclusive and sustainable solution.</span></p> <p><span>We have much to fix, but we have come along way since the days Napoleon and his savants arrived in Alexandria. The trinkets sold on the streets outside every UNESCO site might be kitschy and are likely made by underpaid factory workers in China, but the crucial difference is that they are sold, not taken. We haven’t yet found a way to scale responsible tourism, but at least we have started to address an extremely exploitative economic equation. The author’s suggestion of tiers of “controlled access” to overcrowded touristic sites and the creation of virtual replicas is frightening in its suggestion of a new economic classification system, though the details are left unclear. Who exactly is to visit the simulated Romes and the fake Venices? Who gets the privilege of “discovering” places thus far un-Instagrammed?</span></p> <p><span>The piece ends with a sentimental recollection of the iconic YSoA Rome Seminar as an antidote to the hurried pace of the average tour. The author identifies its students as somehow distinct from the swathes of mass tourists that infiltrate the city every summer, because they draw. But perhaps what really distinguishes a sensitive tourist is not so much their desire to sketch or take a selfie as their ability to see the continuum of history in the things they come across, a cord that tethers them to the seeming “otherness” of experiences, people, and things. The spolia freckling the Arch of Constantine are products of immense human conflict and the obelisk in the centre of the Piazza Navona is an object in exile. We perch at the edge of a long, brutal timeline.</span></p> <p><span>This is not an invitation to constantly decry colonialism, which is now a fundamental fact of humanity. It is a call to be more empathetic about what we experience and who we encounter, wherever we may go. Even the ugly knockoffs bemoaned by tourists of “taste” are the latest chapter in a history of imbalanced global supply chains. We might be sensitive enough to support more local industries as we select things to take home with us, as one way of seeking moments of discovery in our now well-traversed world.</span></p> <p><span>So, to answer the question posed in the title of the article, no – today’s travellers need not fall off the map for the pleasure of surprise.
