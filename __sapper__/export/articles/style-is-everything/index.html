It is understandable that our two institutions are two sides of the same coin. The work at the GSD was very well executed, the student body very finely tuned, and the faculty impeccable, making it hard to find any viable faults. As a matter of fact, the overall experience was so smooth, and the work was so well executed, that it was almost suspicious. The unity of form, space, and materiality that stretched across studios and electives made it easy for all of the projects to look like a collective whole in the exhibition space.
