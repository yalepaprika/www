From concept to implementation to function, my work often defines architecture as an interactive tool, a frame for the public to engage with in the creation of a shelter or space that is fluid and adaptive rather than hardened and defined. Enabling the individual(s) to construct environments, tangible and intangible, acknowledges a shift in the creation and ownership of the architecture or landscape, making it more democratic and in-tune with societal needs and desires. This framing, within the established narrative as well as the activation of an architecture, permits a heightened definition and focus on the people, the essence of architecture.</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Gabriella Dâ€™Angelo"},"slug":"gabriella-dangelo","meta":{"degree":" ","graduation_year":""}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Frame + Essence"},"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"16","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-02-23"}}}}
