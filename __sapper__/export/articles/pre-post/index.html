Here’s what they sent back:</p> <p>1: CARAL VALLEY<br> The Peruvian inhabitants of this coastal valley started building the first monumental sacred city in Peru, some 500 centuries ago. They managed to understand that they should build in the arid slopes in order to leave the fertile valley dedicated to agriculture. That scheme (esquema de implantación) lasted until the Spaniards came to America and started building cities along the rivers. Today, most of the fertile valleys along the desert coast are collapsing under urban pressure.</p> <p>2: MORAY TERRACES<br> The Central Andes mountains were domesticated by humans by building water retaining infrastructures and building artificial flat ground in the vertical landscape. Moray agricultural terraces in Cusco are an outstanding example on how to modify nature for production purposes and being able to build a beautiful landscape.</p> <p>3: MARAS INCA SALT MINE<br> The production of salt in Maras (Cusco) create an anthropic landscape ruled by gravity and salty water flow. Sun radiation is used to dry the shallow ponds and extract salt. The local community is still producing salt nowadays.</p> <p>4: SEASONAL<br> FERTILE HILLS IN LIMA<br> The natural phenomenon of Lomas in the arid Pacific range of Central Andes, once used to collect water in the coastal desert, encroaches with the growing informal city in Lima. The land is occupied in summer, while there is no vegetation, dangerously shrinking this unique seasonal landscape.</p> <p>5: ANDES<br> FOOTHILLS IN CHOSICA<br> The city of Lima is growing up on the foothills of the Andes, occupying dry basins and high risk areas. When rain comes with El Niño, landslides occur and disaster happens.</p> <p>6: PIURA AND ENSO<br> El Niño Southern Oscillation bring tropical rains to the North of Peru in a circle of 10 to 15 years, which can be a great thing if cities were not<br> built in risk zones.
