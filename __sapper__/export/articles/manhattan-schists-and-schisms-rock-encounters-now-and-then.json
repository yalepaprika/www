{"title":{"rendered":"Manhattan Schists and Schisms  (Rock encounters now and then)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Saint Nicholas Avenue in Harlem follows an old Lenape trail which runs obliquely north-south from 111th Street to 193rd Street, breaking the grid. In a section near 131st Street, across from the row of tenement housing, Manhattan Schist lifts up. Like the City, which is constantly changing through the process of demolition and construction, this rock is metamorphic. Folded in steep anticlines and synclines, discreet, modestly housed in dank storage reserves. Traces of undisclosed and unspeakable colonial conduct are reassembled by the attentive, but it is impossible to measure the incommunicability of what is missing. </p>\n<p>Mold does not produce its own food; it is heterotrophic. Archive mold feeds on sources, citations, bibliographies, all organic materials. The daring, reaching hyphae, or flaments, are characteristic of fungus, of which mold is a subtype with over one hundred thousand species. Hyphal growth pierces through exterior veneers in its search for nutrients. The extending structures inject degrading substances to make material more digestible—a slow, seasonal feast, sometimes leaving a colorful mess, other times just gray. Repeated exposure to mold, and inhalation of noxious mycotoxins, can be harmful to humans in close proximity, causing allergic reactions, asthma, and chronic lung irritation. </p>\n<p>France is considering throwing out a large portion of its archives, only keeping what the state and cultural departments determine as essential. Funds for staff upkeep and storage space are limited. The archives, many of which have never been opened, are time-consuming and expensive to protect and preserve because of the mold, among other threats. A friend tells me professors are now asking students to propose PhDs with long lists of potential archives to lay claim to the unopened boxes, in an effort to demonstrate their worth to future research. I wonder where the organic material goes once it is deemed inessential, and all that might sprout from a composted mound of colonial and bureaucratic rot.</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction over biotic resources, trash or treasure, extends beyond the ethics of recycling paper trails of colonialism. Exploitation of natural resources of former, overseas territories continues. These operations are justified by the paradoxical logic that resources must be extracted, catalogued, and named in order to conserve them. Madagascar, with highly coveted precious stones and endemic flora and fauna, is subjected to this colonial approach to global resources in which claims to natural world expertise seem to answer for unchecked access to land exploitation by unelected managers. Conservation of an archive is different from land conservation, however. Archival preservation seeks to protect patrimony from the natural process of the degradation of organic matter—paper, dead plant material—denying the fibrous cellulose pulp its ceremonious return to soil. Like a pastoral forest or a bog, its identity in its present form is already overdetermined and too politically valuable to be eaten by fungus. It is entirely its surface, under threat.</p>\n<p>The fungus-fighting staff and the very architecture of the space tries to keep it inhospitable to growth, keeping it a clean, airy, and stable environment. In the natural world, mold spores are everywhere. In the archive, elements are controlled to minimize their presence. It requires diligent surveillance, but mold is not visible to the human eye until it is already thriving. Early mold detection can salvage and stabilize a collection through careful execution of practiced techniques, all of which take time and care. Means of disarming the fungal threat include isolating the objects, deactivating, or removing the dead and dry mold, cleaning, and monitoring. Personal protective gear worn in a mold outbreak looks like an astronaut suit. Colored blooms cause stains that cannot be removed and sometimes look like dust from Mars.</p>\n<p>The threat of nature and its boundary-crossing into the human sensorium has always figured into colonial relationships. In Western and European visions of the world, a nature-culture divide necessitates the existence of nature and therefore always calls it into relation. In this view, culture in all of its industrial iterations is in tension with nature, its complement and detriment. Nature needs to be controlled, disciplined, and contained. This inverse, symbiotic, mutually reinforcing relationship between distinct nature and distinct culture makes nature a protagonist or antagonist, sidekick, or crush, or nemesis in any story the West tells itself about itself. It also contains the counter-narrative which would destroy its entire self-conception, the decay of its original meaning. When nature protests being made property, it can be as large-scale as a water crisis or a noxious sentence—at best a slowleaking nuisance. After foods and disasters, mold is ubiquitous. In the aftermath, mold is another threat, an opportunistic, slow thief, often in conditions where concerns are more pressing than dampness and decay.</p>\n<p>In the documents I consult at other archives, colonizers always wrote about the weather. Complaints about heat, rain, humidity, and wind-fueled waves occupy large parts of the travel journals of missionaries, scientists, and administrators. As much as tempests were blamed for the white man’s discontent, the conditions were also seen as potential challenges with high rewards. Mosquitoes, flash floods, sapphires, carnivorous mammals, volcanoes: each holding a potential conquest. This reverence for nature, simultaneous adoration and fear, paired with imperial thirst, encouraged “experts” and hobbyists alike to database, catalogue, and sample for exploitation once control could be secured. These experts amassed millions of objects and sent them back to Europe. There, they placed these under scrutiny before forgetting about them, many falling into disrepair, many tucked into bags and boxes, envelopes and pieces of cloth that have not since been opened. Once the world has been named, it can be properly managed. But according to whom and with what permission?</p>\n<p>When mold degrades, uncontrolled, there is some remainder it never fully digests. There is no foretelling which boxes, chapters, phrases, or letters might hold after the fungi have done their work. Mold destroys and degrades. Or so we are led to think. In the midst of its presumed destruction, it generates new worlds. The hyphae edge through empire ruins toward a promise of post-colonial rebellion. As mold moves through space in unpredictable ways, what can and cannot—what will and will not—be preserved, if anything at all, is unknowable.</p>\n<p>**This essay is excerpted from Chanelle Adams’s 2018 essay “The Archives Need to Breathe,” originally published in <em>HUMANxNATURE</em>.
