Operating as the innovation branch of its parent company, Piaggio Group, Piaggio Fast Forward proposes and develops new lightweight mobility platforms which address the needs of future cities and their inhabitants.

Led by its co-founders, Jeffrey Schnapp and Greg Lynn, the company approaches mobility through the lens of architecture.

Directly following my undergraduate studies at SCI-Arc from 2003–2008, I worked at Machineous, realizing projects for other architects or artists. It was simple: drawings, 3D models, and budgets came in, and projects, prototypes, and installations went out. More often than not, these were “one-offs,” meaning each project was an opportunity for us to reinvent our workflow and develop a new approach to a new problem. From there, I was appointed to SCI-Arc’s Robot House, where for two years I facilitated various design studios and seminars utilizing the lab as a grounds for research and experimentation. Since then, I’ve gone on to complete my graduate studies at MIT, which allowed me to build on my trajectory thus far. </span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the task at hand, I’ve always taken an architectural approach. PFF’s first product, Gita, which was revealed in February of 2017, is a prime example. Leveraging a collaboration with mechanical, electrical, and software engineers as well as boat builders in Bristol, RI, Gita is the result of design thinking that spans disciplines and scales both conceptually and literally. Much like the work of Eladio Dieste or Felix Candela, its structure is its envelope vis a vis its overall spherical form. It is design thinking that enables projects such as Gita, a vehicle the size of a bean bag, to be perceived as no different than a full scale building.</span></p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
