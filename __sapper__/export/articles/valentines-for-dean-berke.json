A goddess.</p>\n<p>I get starstruck when you come up to the 7th floor.</p>\n<p>So much fangirling.</p>\n<p>Good job! Keep it up!</p>\n<p>Love the different cocktails.</p>\n<p>Your thoughtful responses to undergrad concerns gives me hope for the people coming into the major.</p>\n<p>Your presence makes us better; your words and actions tenfold so.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking us seriously. It&#8217;s a nice feeling.</p>\n<p>Love the way you put it “architecture majors and talented and very under-appreciated.”</p>\n<p>I had to resist the urge to pump my fist victoriously in the air when Cynthia Zarin quoted you in her Daily Themes lecture.</p>\n<p>Thank you for understanding the post-graduation plight of international students at this (and every other) architecture school. STEM OPT might cease to exist, but I’m grateful that you cared enough to try.</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Admirers from YSoA</p>\n"},"meta":{"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"Frame + Essence"},"slug":"frame-essence","meta":{"volume":"2","number":"16","bulletin":false,"publication_date":"2017-02-23"}}}}
