While I share his argument for taking a position in architecture, and for articulating a direction in architectural teaching, I disagree with his proposition that Yale lacks either. Despite the array of practitioners and theorists &#8220;from the most extreme ends of the spectrum of design,&#8221; in the end, it is still a school of Architecture dedicated to building, a fact emphasized by Dean Stern during the 2014 open house and reinforced by the building project. In today&#8217;s era when practices invest in research more than design, when studios are renamed “laboratories,”</span><span>1</span><span> and when even the name &#8220;architecture&#8221; is replaced by a cooler-sounding &#8220;design&#8221; in many academic and professional circles, I think architecture itself is the most prevalent ideology of the school.</span></p>\n<p><span>Moreover, I would not equate exposure to a multitude of ideas with ceasing to develop one&#8217;s &#8220;own understanding and convictions about what is right in architecture.&#8221; This understanding and belief structure should be reinforced through a process of questioning, reasoning, testing, colliding, and weighing it against what others believe—the very process of &#8220;positive friction&#8221; that Daniel himself advocates as requisite for better learning. After all, as the article suggests, architecture is a matter of subjective judgement; therefore, confining it to certain metrics of success is ineffective.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if the current pluralistic methodology at YSOA were to be replaced by a singular ideology, it makes us question: what it would be? Would it stay relevant tomorrow without becoming another trendy &#8220;-ism&#8221;? I believe the true strength of the school is its disciplinary focus, while allowing students the freedom to interpret the discipline in our own way and with our own values.</span></p>\n<p><span>1.
