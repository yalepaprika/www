Ostrum observed, on the one hand, that large, geographically detached economic or political institutions with vested interest in maximizing consumption tend to be poor (or, at best, clumsy) resource administrators. Local populations, on the other hand, receive direct feedback about the impacts of overuse and are therefore more likely to arrest exploitation and successfully govern their resources. Contemporary Japan’s relationship to timber as both a local cultural treasure and a global economic commodity is a perfect expression of the NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard) of that country’s advanced economic status within the social and environmental ranks of industrial modernity. Effective environmental stewardship would call for a system-wide assessment, an accounting of the ebbs and flows of material and energy through the entire economic supply chain.</span></p> <p><b>How does a model of this kind of stewardship delineate the natural world into that which is for our use – the constructed natural – and that which is preserved – the truly natural (or at least conceived as truly natural)?

Certainly, it both opposes nature in producing shelter and depends materially on it for its manifestation.</b> <b>How do you see this playing out in contemporary architecture – particularly that which concerns itself with “sustainability” or new construction practices? Is there value in biomimetic, symbiotic building practice? Or is it no longer applicable?</b></p> <p><span>Sentimental notions of the natural as something we can retrieve — or, failing that, mimic — aestheticize and trivialize the complex political and environmental interactions of human society and culture with the physical resources and ecosystem services on which it depends.</span></p> <p><span>This is the real danger we face, particularly as architects, who are at once avid technologists and all-too-convincing story-tellers. We make claims for our work but often fail to substantiate them. Recent vintages of “sustainable” architecture boast enormous energy performance benefits but call on excessive quantities of material and carbon-intensive technologies to produce and maintain them. The formal (as well as material and technical) luxuries of our most celebrated buildings often come at significant cost to the populations that subsidize them and offer only bespoke solutions without broad application or sufficient ecological import. We propose dramatic increases in the consumption of energy and matter to build adaptive (read defensive) buildings, without acknowledging that the production of infrastructural megaprojects usually fails to mitigate, and may actually exacerbate, the accretion of greenhouse gases that produce the effects of climate change we seek to defend ourselves against in the first place. This reflects either too narrow an analytical framework, deeply flawed thinking, or gross hypocrisy. It is the inherent contradiction embedded in the concept of “sustainable development.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Rather than suggest specific solutions— there are many that at the moment that seem at least superficially attractive but demand real scrutiny and assessment rather than uncritical promotion (these might include building materials drawn from the waste stream or synthesized biologically; design approaches that mimic or even incorporate biological systems; building practices that capture and store carbon; planning that reduces not only the embodied impacts but also the literal footprint of building and infrastructure…)– I’d simply note that the architect’s toolbox has everything needed to research, analyze, experiment with, visualize and ultimately work within a paradigm of </span><i><span>scarcity</span></i><span>, instead of under the pretense of infinite </span><i><span>natural</span></i><span> abundance and implicit technological capacity.</span></p> <p><b>Where does this leave us? How does an understanding that humankind participates in this global ecological metabolism – the growth of which seems to depend deeply on a reciprocal system of phenotypic interaction – inform our conception of…well everything, but specifically architecture? Particularly when considering that the destructive nature of humankind can be considered a natural phenotypic extension of a successful species, it becomes complicated to discuss an idea of stewardship or conservation without its implications inside of this genotype-phenotype interaction. Further, it seems to bring up the possibility that to do so might be either evolutionary or moral, or both. What might architecture seek to accomplish, then? </b></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Architecture, the conception, visualization, and production of the built environment, is a discipline which operates at and around the center of the global environmental “disturbance” that has become the most significant planetary marker of our species.  This is not at all to say that architects have been the motive force in each of the incremental conceptual shifts that have culminated in the current modes of thought and human behavior or the economic and political institutions that have arisen from them. But architecture, with its cultural narratives of vision, orchestration, and mastery (of form, of space, of land, of material, of technology, of social organizations) has sat at the right hand of those motivators of institutional and environmental change, providing vivid visualizations of new forms of human settlement, facilitating enormous transactions of material and energy, and helping generally to give shape to the habits of extraction and consumption in the global marketplace. So as both a means of conceptualizing the use of material to form human habitation and of communicating a set of values embedded in that form, architecture is at its best a flow of ethical (rather than purely aesthetic) decisions, sweeping in purview but, in their realization (taking up as metaphor Dawkins’s formulation of the extended phenotype) necessarily incremental and adaptive. Can these decisions be both better informed (by a more profound analysis and understanding of geochemical, geophysical, and geo-biological systems) and more critical of the institutional apparatus (economic, political, industrial, professional, etc) that prescribes the means by which we work, the materials we call up, and the expectations of those inhabitants for whom we would build? I would say yes, without a doubt.</span></p> </div> </div> </main></div> <script> !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)

It is the inherent contradiction embedded in the concept of “sustainable development.”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ERather than suggest specific solutions— there are many that at the moment that seem at least superficially attractive but demand real scrutiny and assessment rather than uncritical promotion (these might include building materials drawn from the waste stream or synthesized biologically; design approaches that mimic or even incorporate biological systems; building practices that capture and store carbon; planning that reduces not only the embodied impacts but also the literal footprint of building and infrastructure…)&#8211; I’d simply note that the architect’s toolbox has everything needed to research, analyze, experiment with, visualize and ultimately work within a paradigm of \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Escarcity\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E, instead of under the pretense of infinite \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Enatural\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E abundance and implicit technological capacity.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhere does this leave us? How does an understanding that humankind participates in this global ecological metabolism &#8211; the growth of which seems to depend deeply on a reciprocal system of phenotypic interaction &#8211; inform our conception of&#8230;well everything, but specifically architecture? Particularly when considering that the destructive nature of humankind can be considered a natural phenotypic extension of a successful species, it becomes complicated to discuss an idea of stewardship or conservation without its implications inside of this genotype-phenotype interaction. Further, it seems to bring up the possibility that to do so might be either evolutionary or moral, or both. What might architecture seek to accomplish, then? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EArchitecture, the conception, visualization, and production of the built environment, is a discipline which operates at and around the center of the global environmental “disturbance” that has become the most significant planetary marker of our species.  This is not at all to say that architects have been the motive force in each of the incremental conceptual shifts that have culminated in the current modes of thought and human behavior or the economic and political institutions that have arisen from them. But architecture, with its cultural narratives of vision, orchestration, and mastery (of form, of space, of land, of material, of technology, of social organizations) has sat at the right hand of those motivators of institutional and environmental change, providing vivid visualizations of new forms of human settlement, facilitating enormous transactions of material and energy, and helping generally to give shape to the habits of extraction and consumption in the global marketplace. So as both a means of conceptualizing the use of material to form human habitation and of communicating a set of values embedded in that form, architecture is at its best a flow of ethical (rather than purely aesthetic) decisions, sweeping in purview but, in their realization (taking up as metaphor Dawkins’s formulation of the extended phenotype) necessarily incremental and adaptive. Can these decisions be both better informed (by a more profound analysis and understanding of geochemical, geophysical, and geo-biological systems) and more critical of the institutional apparatus (economic, political, industrial, professional, etc) that prescribes the means by which we work, the materials we call up, and the expectations of those inhabitants for whom we would build? I would say yes, without a doubt.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"},meta:{contributors:[{title:{rendered:"Jonathan Molloy"},slug:"jonathan-molloy",meta:{degree:"M.Arch I",graduation_year:"2018"}},{title:{rendered:"Alan Organschi"},slug:"alan-organschi",meta:{degree:"Critic",graduation_year:""}}],fold:{title:{rendered:"(de)Natured"},slug:"denatured",meta:{volume:"1",number:"22",bulletin:false,publication_date:"2016-03-28"}}}}}]};</script><script src=/client/f72b9e6a932f4f0fb2bc/main.js></script>
