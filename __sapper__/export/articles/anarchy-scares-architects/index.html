How about the way the majority of the architecture students strive to create spaces that attempt to be “social condensers” – have you ever considered that maybe the society does not want to be condensed? What about the battles you wage in terms of representation – your architectural drawings are so “experimental,” that your jurors have to struggle to read your “analytiques”?

But you know, now that’s Anarchy – f*ck contextualism and originality (I know, I’m going to get roasted on this, because, what does originality in architecture even mean anymore? (Also, side note maybe I should have written something for “F*ck that,” Vol 3, Issue 16)). Also – yes, I am digressing heavily – let’s pretend to pay attention to those who try to critique architecture without actually being an architect, because if there’s one thing we agree on, it’s how only architects know what architecture truly is.
