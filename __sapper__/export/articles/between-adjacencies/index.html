The architects’ facility with digital tools is manifest in a parade of diverse drawing and modeling techniques. At a quick glance, this show could be mistaken for the fetishization of kitsch or stylism, but behind the flashy imagery, each of these projects contains complex ideas on construction and imagery. Jennifer Bonner’s Haus Gables, for example, explores material capabilities and connotations as a building moves from conceptual to material.
