A modernist artist is so deeply aware of this possibility of otherwise-ness that he feels a deep unease about simply accepting his own sensibility. He feels a need for some reason that will convince him that he ought to feel one way rather than another.” I think that awareness of what Hubbard calls an awareness of the possibility of otherwise-ness helps to explain the fascination with theory, so pronounced among avant-garde architects.

But Venturi’ s understanding of decorated sheds also raises questions.

To address that problem I have developed at some length, especially in </span><i><span>The Ethical Function of Architecture </span></i><span>my understanding of the re-presentational function of beauty.
