{"content":{"rendered":"<p><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> is a broadsheet published by the students of the Yale School of Architecture. The publication takes its name from the bold shade of orange carpeting Rudolph Hall, the epicenter of student life at YSoA.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> seeks to empower and encourage critical discourse among the student body. We are of, by, and for students of architecture. Our submissions are open; our meetings are open. Each fold is edited by a new team of student editors, representing all degree programs and years at the school. Editors curate content under a theme of their choosing, receiving contributions from faculty, students, and staff at YSoA, all the while reaching out beyond </span><i><span>Paprika!’s </span></i><span>roots in Rudolph Hall to engage with the campus, profession, and discipline at large. Our publication provides an essential and timely outlet for student voices to contribute to a larger discussion. </span></p>\n<p><i><span>Paprika!</span></i><span> is published on Thursdays, aligning with the school’s lecture series, and has proved instrumental in establishing a relationship between YSoA and the Yale School of Art. Editorial teams work with graphic designers from the School of Art to bring the publication to life every Thursday. </span><i><span>Paprika! </span></i><span>provides a ground for editorial experimentation in its design and in its content.</span></p>\n<p>Founded in the summer of 2014, Paprika! is now entering its third year in print. The broadsheet has quickly amassed an international readership of 358 (and counting!). Since its inception, 38 folds have been published, with an additional nine slated for the fall of 2017. Rooted in the prideful principle of autonomy and independence from our home institution, the Yale School of Architecture, Paprika! receives no fiscal support from the school. We need your help to bring these folds to life.</p>\n"}}
