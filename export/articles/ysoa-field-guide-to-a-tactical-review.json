No part of the final review should be taken for granted. All parts can be tweaked and curated to benefit our learning experience. Below are a few suggestions:<br />\n<em>—Decide your review structure</em><br />\nThink about which review setting will be best for your studio: traditional, science fair, two-up, etc.<br />\n<em>—Design the seating</em><br />\nEye contact is important. Sit in a circle or scatter jurors among students to encourage broader participation.<br />\n<em>—Introduce yourself</em><br />\nThis is a method of social priming. Students in the studio can introduce themselves briefly. Instead of being introduced by the coordinator, jurors can introduce themselves to the students directly.<br />\n<em>—Invite critics</em><br />\nStudents can email their studio coordinators suggestions for critics.<br />\n<em>—Widen the circle</em><br />\nInvite at least one non-architect or ‘expert’ juror. Depending on the studio this could be an urbanist, an artist, a sociologist, a community organizer, a scientist, a builder, etc.<br />\n<em>—Ask questions</em><br />\nTo help with this, each studio can prepare several questions to ask during the review.</p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Dante Furioso"},"slug":"dante-furioso","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2016"}}],"fold":{"title":{"rendered":"What Are You Doing?"},"meta":{"volume":"1","number":"15","publication_date":"2015-12-17"}}}}
