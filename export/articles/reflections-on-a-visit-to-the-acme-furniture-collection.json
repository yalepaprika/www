Given the pressures he faces as an independent business owner, not to mention the added strain of an internal familial dispute over the future prospects and/or value of a 3</span><span>rd</span><span> generation family-owned institution, I can only fathom the deep-seated conviction to his family’s heritage that he holds fast to. The lone crusader in a downhill battle to preserve and restore against all odds, Greenberg’s situation seems like the live re-adaptation of an all-too-familiar American plotline.</span></p>\n<p><span>Reflecting on the size, complexity, value, and future potential of Mr. Greenberg’s archaeological opus in turn raises two critical concerns:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><span>What is the value of heritage on the scale of the city and what is its significance to architectural design?<br />\n</span></em>It seems paradoxical that a local figure in historic preservation as notable as Mr. Greenberg would find himself threatened by the current climate of a real estate market, which over the last decade has begun to value historic preservation as a central factor to the development of ‘identity’ and ‘place’ within successful architecture.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><em><span>Can ‘Heritage’ be valued or commoditized?<br />\n</span></em>This may be an open ended question, but I can’t help but relate with anecdotes on a personal and recently professional level.  For one, even my own family has struggled to find value in the preservation of artifacts after selling off a fourth generation family-run wholesale foods company. One could say that these labels lost all value after the brand was absorbed by a larger corporation, and yet to our family these items were instantly priceless. I’ve encountered a similar re-valuing of heritage on an urban scale this past year when working to design a mixed-use urban redevelopment in Atlanta on the brownfield site of a since-demolished historic steel mill.  In a sense, the city of Atlanta was resurrecting a once-erased urban infrastructural heritage for the sake of inventing a sense of ‘place’ and ‘historic character’ virtually from scratch. There was even talk of programming a museum of Atlanta Industrial History within the complex as a testimony to the city’s industrial heritage evoked by the design.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>In considering my exposure to both sides to the equation in questioning the representational, cultural, commercial, and financial worth of ‘heritage’ in relation to Mr. Greenberg’s present situation, I can’t help but turn to the plot of Arthur Miller’s “The Price.”  A play eerily reflective of the current condition of New Haven’s ACME Furniture, one quote in particular resonates strongly as a cautionary theatrical relic of advice.  “</span><span>Don&#8217;t be seduced into thinking that that which does not make a profit is without value.”</span></p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Davis Butner"},"slug":"davis-butner","meta":{"degree":"M.Arch I","graduation_year":"2019"}}],"fold":{"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"05","publication_date":"2016-10-13"}}}}
