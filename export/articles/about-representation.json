I think there&#8217;s reason to contest what defines &#8220;retro&#8221;/old vs. &#8220;modern&#8221;/new. In my opinion, the two terms are constantly in a state of interchangeability, where the old becomes the new and the new becomes the old. Just look at fashion &#8211; one moment something was in, the next something&#8217;s out and what was originally a fashion no-no becomes a revamped &#8220;it&#8221; thing of the now.</span></p>\n<p><span>I don&#8217;t know about the specific use of &#8220;dots, dashes, plus signs&#8221; but perhaps as a generation that&#8217;s been inundated with flashy architectural imagery and renderings, we collectively feel numb toward them: that despite their vibrancy and vividness, they are the ones that have actually become boring and have been exhausted; the novelty and the craziness of the forms and the representation of forms through these new digital media have worn out. </span></p>\n<p><span>And I think that&#8217;s what makes people turn toward these &#8220;boring&#8221; and &#8220;old&#8221; things. Maybe we feel too overwhelmed &#8211; and perhaps, also </span><i><span>under</span></i><span>whelmed &#8211; by all that we see being produced nowadays&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span>But at the same time, maybe representation isn&#8217;t the problem. Sometimes I find myself going back and forth between how representation should be used or what role it should play in the effectiveness of the project. For instance, what happens when everyone has the same representation method? If we took all of our second year projects and used a singular representation, maybe the things that appeared crazy aren’t so crazy after all and those that seemed boring aren&#8217;t actually boring. </span></p>\n<p><span>Also &#8211; then it makes me wonder &#8211; do you mean experimentation just in representation or in our actual interpretation of the brief of the building that needs to be built? Because if you mean the latter as well, I think I both agree and disagree in that there needs to be more experimentation. Well, more accurately, less unbridled experimentation but more intentional experimentation. </span></p>\n<p><span>Do you feel like you&#8217;re being experimental with your architecture and representation and that because of the general vibe or tone of YSOA that it&#8217;s being excluded or not accepted? </span></p>\n<p><b>On Fri, Oct 28, 2016 at 10:49 AM, Dylan Weiser wrote:</b></p>\n<p><span>Regarding your last question, it&#8217;s not about being accepted or included. </span></p>\n<p><span>There should always be people who don&#8217;t agree with things that you are interested in.
