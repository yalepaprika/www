Topics range from headline catastrophes such as global warming, ozone depletion, and nuclear winter to historical debates about the age of the Earth, the nature of fossils, and the management of natural resources. Tensions between science and religion; the role of science in government; environmental economics; the politics of prediction, modeling, and incomplete evidence.</p> <p> </p> <p>7.</p> <p>Course Number: HSAR753</p> <p>Course Title: Theories of Imagination and Visual Perception</p> <p>Professor: Margaret Olin</p> <p>Time: Wednesday, 10:30-12:20</p> <p>Description: This seminar traces the role of imagination and visual perception as conceived by philosophers, phenomenologists, perceptual psychologists, and other theorists in mainly Western thought since the seventeenth century. The ways in which perception and imagination are conceived together are informed by changing conceptions of each term. “Imagination” can be seen as a mental power of internal image making that must be considered separately from perception, or it may be considered as an indispensable component of perception, which itself can be conceived as a more or less faithful representation or a creative process.</p> <p> </p> <p>8.</p> <p>Course Number: AMST 348</p> <p>Course Title: Space, Place, and Landscape</p> <p>Professor: Laura Barraclough</p> <p>Time: Wednesday, 1:30-3:20pm</p> <p>Description: Survey of core concepts in cultural geography and spatial theory. Ways in which the organization, use, and representation of physical spaces produce power dynamics related to colonialism, race, gender, class, and migrant status. Multiple meanings of home; the politics of place names; effects of tourism; the aesthetics and politics of map making; spatial strategies of conquest. Includes field projects in New Haven.</p> <p> </p> <p>9.</p> <p>Course Number: HSAR606</p> <p>Course Title: Global Renaissance</p> <p>Professor: Kishwar Rizvi</p> <p>Time: Tuesday, 10:30-12:20</p> <p>Description: This seminar focuses on current scholarship that posits the connected nature of maritime cultures of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Looking from the perspectives of both Europe and the Islamic world, the seminar considers the mobility of ideas and objects and the communities of merchants, artists, and scholars who traveled from Japan to England to the Americas. The mobility brought about profound cultural changes that were reflected and augmented by changes in the urban, architectural, and artistic productions of this period.</p> <p> </p> <p>10.</p> <p>Course Number: AMST 125 / AFAM 125 / HIST 136</p> <p>Course Title: The Long Civil Rights Movement</p> <p>Professor: Crystal N Feimster</p> <p>Time: Monday, Wednesday; 11:35-12:25pm</p> <p>Description: Political, social, and artistic aspects of the U.S. civil rights movement from the 1920s through the 1980s explored in the context of other organized efforts for social change.
