My friend and I were in the area for its rock climbing. We had been enticed to the farm by its cheap lodging and yoga room, and the inherent promises of novelty, or at least quirkiness. We checked in during the middle of the night (“Yeah don’t worry; it won’t be locked.”) and hence did not meet any permanent residents until the following morning.

Permaculture (“permanent agriculture”) is a systematic method of design formalized by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in the late 1970’s. As a response to industrial agriculture, which they perceived as detrimental to biodiversity, soil fertility, and future availability of resources, Mollison and Holmgren developed a framework influenced by both pre-industrial farming methods and practices of forest gardening that had been germinating in the decades prior.</p> <p><a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods.png><img alt=outofthewoods class="alignnone wp-image-985" height=276 sizes="(max-width: 234px) 85vw, 234px" src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods.png srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods.png 430w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods-254x300.png 254w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods-230x272.png 230w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods-350x413.png 350w" width=234></a>              <a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2.png><img alt=outofthewoods2 class="alignnone wp-image-986" height=281 sizes="(max-width: 221px) 85vw, 221px" src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2.png srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2.png 406w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2-236x300.png 236w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2-230x293.png 230w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/outofthewoods2-350x446.png 350w" width=221></a></p> <p>Site plans of D Acres (Courtesy of Josh Trought)</p> <p>Put simply, permaculture is a way of producing food and materials by building in a way that both mimics and works with nature. It de-emphasizes human intervention in favor of a deep understanding and application of natural processes. In practice, this involves techniques like keeping a seasonal diet, cultivating many plant species in the same area, and using cardboard to imitate the role of leaves on the forest floor—stifling weeds while decomposing and returning organic matter to the soil, like recycled mulch.</p> <p>The residents at D Acres—including a YC Class of 2011 Yale alumna—walked us through forested trails to treehouse residences, berry shrubs, and vegetable patches. Their pigs had been let out into one of the fields so that they could rout through the soil and kitchen scraps dumped there, simultaneously feeding the pig and mixing organic material into the earth. For meals Root made salads and stews and strawberry-herb sauces and even homemade mayonnaise, using ingredients either from their own land or which “could reasonably be grown” in rural New England. The toilets were placed atop long chutes leading to a basement collector for “humanure” and flushed with a bowl of sawdust. They offered us the option of waking up at five in the morning to watch them wrangle some pigs. We declined. If these were hippies or hipsters, we had the sense that they dropped less acid than the ones in the seventies and did more physical labor than the ones in New Haven.</p> <p>The way that D Acres founder Josh Trought has set up the principles of life on the homestead reverberates through the way they have shaped the space around them. In addition to the compost toilets, D Acres has its own electrical and heating infrastructures, featuring solar water heaters and wood-burning stoves. But the home itself is only a small component of the space used for living. In the permaculture categorization of human environments, it is Zone 0. Zones 1 through 4 are cultivated lands, ranging from heavily managed salad crops and compost bins in Zone 1 to the semi-wild foraging that occurs in Zone 4. Zone 5 is pure wilderness, reserved for the observation of natural patterns and the enriching buildup of bacteria, molds, and insects. Though some zones are more frequently touched than others, all are necessary for a sustainable human ecosystem.</p> <p><a href=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw.png><img alt=ootw class="alignnone size-full wp-image-987" height=518 sizes="(max-width: 508px) 85vw, 508px" src=https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw.png srcset="https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw.png 508w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw-294x300.png 294w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw-230x235.png 230w, https://d2rpbtor0vesnk.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ootw-350x357.png 350w" width=508></a></p> <p>The Five Spatial Zones of Permaculture</p> <p>Whereas so much of sustainable design today is premised on new technology and design that accommodates a consumer lifestyle, the design of D Acres above all is an illustration of an environment built and adapted around a conscientious mode of living. Successful permaculture requires that form follows philosophy, whereas in most LEED-certified buildings today, form tries to make up for a lack it.</p> <p>Permaculture, then, is not only an agricultural method or a lifestyle, but an aesthetic.</p> <p>In the documentary miniseries Phantom India, director Louis Malle muses that he, a modern, Western man, was “master of time, slave to time.” Life at D Acres is also enslaved by time, but not to a kind of time that can be mastered.
