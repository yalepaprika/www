Damisch deconstructs the phenomenological and physical structures of La Tourette, analyzes them with his own experience and thought, then concludes that La Tourette is a conceptual work from “the top down and from the inside out.” He references Le Corbusier’s explanation of the project as the most explicit summation, “Walking is from the first a part of the phenomena constituted in perspectives through the play of all the kinesthesis together. And this occurs already in closed spaces, in which everything becomes accessible in the normal way and everything is thus constituted in the same way as real things spatiotemporally exterior to one another.” Here, by citing Le Corbusier directly, Damisch attributes the material experience of space in La Tourette to the controversial rationalist. </span></p> <p>If you take anything away from this review, let it be that Damisch is a “displaced philosopher” viewing architecture from an alternative perspective.
