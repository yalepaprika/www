Diploma presentations aside, her frequent studio reviews were most telling. There, every so often seemingly snoozing, at times ostentatiously absorbed into active text messaging, she was notorious for lulling her students into a false sense of security as presentations went on and on. In fact, no one was more perceptive than she was. If a design caught her attention–for good reasons and bad reasons–she would suddenly jump into the discussion, only to pierce through a project in the blink of an eye, anatomizing with just a few words what others were rambling on forever and ever while still failing to say what they wanted to say.

The three lines she drew usually fixed it within seconds.
