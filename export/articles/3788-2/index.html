Yale’s first eight residential colleges were designed by architect James Gamble Rogers primarily in the Collegiate Gothic, or “Girder Gothic,” style—which was ultimately a derivative of the Gothic Revival style seen at Cambridge and Oxford Colleges. Two notable exceptions were Rogers’s Pierson and Davenport Colleges—residences nine and ten were designed by John Russell Pope in a medley of Gothic Revival, French Renaissance, and Georgian Revival styles.

RAMSA has given the approximately 1,300 Yale undergraduate students who flood campus each fall what they want: a glimpse into the English university system, replete with charm and scholasticism. At the Yale School of Architecture’s symposium “Rebuilding Architecture” this past weekend, several individuals presented distinct modes of practicing design. Of particular interest to this argument was Yale Lecturer Phil Bernstein’s talk, “<em>Commodity Exchange | Outcome Delivery</em>.” Bernstein posited that in its current form, architects are expected to deliver architecture as a commodity rather than being compensated based on the creation of ideal outcomes. Yet, as long as architecture remains a client-centric profession, in any form, giving a client what they want does not make for a sound foundation for stylistic critique. In helping Yale University sustain the myth of the quintessential collegiate experience, all key players have benefited up to now. As in the case at Miami University with the Farmer School of Business, RAMSA not only avoids rocking the boat, but we can assume does so quite profitably.
