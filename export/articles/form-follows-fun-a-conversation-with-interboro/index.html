In, say, the design of a public space or a master plan, you won’t get people to talk about the issues unless you make it fun to do so. We try to create spaces that bring many different kinds of people together, and we believe that you can’t do that without engagement. Nothing we do starts with a sketch or a computer model. It starts with asking people what they would want. After all, we’re designing spaces that we don’t live in, planning for neighborhoods that we’re not from. It’s not ours, it’s theirs. So we consider ourselves public servants, trying to make spaces that people want and will use. </span></p> <p><span>Right now, we’re working on a citywide plan for Cambridge, and we are trying to reach as many people as possible, particularly including those who normally wouldn’t come to a meeting on a Tuesday evening at 6 o’clock. Our main device is a series of ‘intercepts’ — through which we try to meet people where they are. We made a gigantic model of the city that’s portable, and we take it around and set it up on street corners. When you put it out on the street, it creates a public space in itself. It’s an interactive model, so people can draw on it, etc. We also have a newspaper that we make as a part of the planning process, that tries to teach people and empower people with knowledge about what planning is, and what the effects of the planning process are like on a city like Cambridge. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><b>How do you manage the many opinions you must receive?</b></p> <p><span>I don’t mean to imply that as designers or planners we should only be listeners, and that if somebody says they want X, we give them X. We are experts, and we do know things, and we should be a resource as much as anything, and work to open people’s minds to consider all other possibilities. The trick is to find a way to open a dialogue to learn from each other. Ultimately, the project is theirs, and they should own it.
