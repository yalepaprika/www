When asked about my own nationality, “Turkish” is almost always followed by, “but I’ve been studying in the US since I was eighteen.” Honestly, if “Architecture” was a nationality, I would feel much more comfortable putting that down on my passport.

If I had been less risk-averse, less inclined to expect the worst from Turkish politics, I might have gone back. Instead, I chose what I found was the safest option possible, albeit at the cost of missing out on spending time at home.
