Sometimes I think I know, but \u0003I rarely actually know [how the final image will turn out]. It’s always kind of a surprise. Even during the process there are a lot of things \u0003that happen where I can’t hold onto something or I’ll \u0003lose an image by the end of it. I enjoy the process of making them and am less invested in them as finished objects. And the fact that they’re unstable too, it’s not like there is a fixed end product. I am not interested in reproducing them. I like them as unique objects. I’ve played with different ways of showing them, mounting them on various substrates, \u0003I welded frames for some. I’ve tried lots of things and am still experimenting.</p>\n<p>I’ve gotten the best feedback from the most unexpected places. I don’t know what it is, but having an open \u0003mind in these kinds of discussions is important because you never know&#8230; That’s been my experience so far.</p>\n"},"meta":{"contributors":[{"title":{"rendered":"Antonia Kuo"},"slug":"antonia-kuo","meta":{"degree":"M.F.A.","graduation_year":"2018"}}],"fold":{"meta":{"volume":"2","number":"04","publication_date":"2016-10-06"}}}}
