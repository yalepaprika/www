The intensity, energy and pace of the semester, with four briefs, translated directly into the students’ work. Each project considered architecture in relation to or with something else, always architecture and… [environment, site, program, ecology]. In PROJECT 1: UNDER, we used water as an immersive, fluid, environmental ground, asking students to create a device which can swim across a pool of water, or one which can float, sink and resurface, given only a week of time.

Each week, Core I Professors presented a term from the created Language Matrix [Kinetic, Hinge, Parti, Typology, Composition, Proportion, Module, Figure Ground] carefully curated to influence student work within a particular project.

While the previous Core I Curriculum used the physical element of water as a continuity between projects, the current curriculum identifies more abstract and conceptual conditions of architecture to be interpreted through four projects in a continuum. The revised curriculum gives students the tools to think systematically in relation to outside forces, tracing networks and ultimately designing their own.
